<h1>Readme for phpLens</h1>
PhpLens is a <b>fast</b> and <b>powerful</b> way to design, 
publish and maintain your databases on the Web and Intranet. 
Why spend more time rewriting the same code over and over again?
<p> 
If you find learning a new scripting or programming language tedious, 
phpLens has <b><i>dynamic editing</i></b>. Dynamic editing makes it easy to start off and prototype,
 visualising and transforming your database without any coding (see picture on the right). 
<p>If you want complete control, phpLens offers <b>over 150 scriptable properties</b> to 
add more power to your PHP code.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>You need PHP 4.0.3 or later and the free Zend Optimizer installed.

<p>Unpack and move all the files so that you can access the files from <i>http://yourserver/php/phplens</i>.
 On my server this is <i>/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/php/phplens</i>.
<p>Read the <a href=license.htm>license.htm</a> file.
<p>Continue with these <a href=help/setup.htm>Setup Instructions</a> after unpacking.
<h3>Where to go from here</h3>
Visit our <a href=http://phplens.com/>phplens.com</a> Web site and <a href=http://phplens.com/lens/ex/>examples</a> for many suggestions on how to use phpLens.
You can view the source code of the examples also.<p>
Read the <a href=help/>manual</a>.<p>
Are you using the Grid Builder? Properly configured, it is a real time-saver because
it will auto-generate all your phpLens code for you.<p>
Do you want to use another language? The language files are provided in source code so they 
can be customised. Send your language files back to us so others can share.<p>
We are using the ADODB database wrapper library to access databases. It is very powerful and
Open Source (except for the text driver which incorporates a built-in database engine). 
The ADODB <a href=adodb/readme.htm>manual</a>, and <a href=http://php.weblogs.com/adodb>Web site</a>.
