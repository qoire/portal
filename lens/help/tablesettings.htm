<h2>Dynamic Editing with Global phpLens Settings</h2>
The Dynamic editor allows you to modify global phpLens settings such as the colors 
and the SQL statement to use. From the top left of the phpLens grid, click the 
red <img src="img/editbtn.gif" width="14" height="13"> Edit phpLens Settings icon 
to run the Dynamic Editor. This will bring you to the page shown below. At the 
top of the page is the menu bar which allows you to move to different dynamic 
editing screens. 
<p><img src=img/editcolors.gif></p>
Just below the menu is the global color settings. On the right is <b>Select Color Style</b> where you can
choose from the preset Color Styles. You can also define your own color styles by adding new array entries 
to the Javascript array PHPLENS_styles in <i>phplens/img/phplens-js.styles.js</i>.
<p>
<p>Below the color settings (not visible in above picture) you can set whether 
  the records can be edited, deleted, or created, define the primary key and table 
  to update, sort and date settings, and whether debugging information is turned 
  on. Context sensitive help is available for most options.</p>
<p>New to phpLens 1.2 is that the SQL and Key Table fields support PHP global variables if the first character
in the field is =. For example, suppose you have multiple tables that hold postcodes for specific countries, eg:
usacodes, japancodes, ukcodes, malaysiacodes. You can store the country in a global variable $COUNTRY and
set the sql property to:
<pre>
=SELECT * FROM {$COUNTRY}CODES
</pre>
