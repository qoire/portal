(( Readme for phpLens ))

PhpLens is a fast and powerful way to design, publish and maintain your 
databases on the Web and Intranet. Why spend more time rewriting the 
same code over and over again? 

If you find learning a new scripting or programming language tedious, 
phpLens has dynamic editing. Dynamic editing makes it easy to start off and 
prototype, visualising and transforming your database without any coding 
(see picture on the right). 

If you want complete control, phpLens offers over 150 scriptable properties 
to add more power to your PHP code.

(( Setup ))

You need PHP 4.0.3 or later and the free Zend Optimizer installed. 

Unpack and move all the files so that you can access the files from 
http://yourserver/php/phplens. On my server this is 
/usr/local/httpd/htdocs/php/phplens. 

Read the license.htm file. 

Continue with these Setup Instructions in 
http://yourserver/php/phplens/help/setup.htm after unpacking . 

(( Where to go from here ))

Visit our phplens.com Web site and try examples for many suggestions on 
how to use phpLens. You can view the source code of the examples also.

Read the phpLens manual.

Are you using the Grid Builder? Properly configured, it is a real 
time-saver because it will autogenerate all the code for you.

Do you want to use another language? The language files are provided in source 
code so they can be customised. Send your language files back to us so others 
can share.

We are using the ADODB database wrapper library to access databases. It is 
very powerful and Open Source (except for the text driver which incorporates 
a built-in database engine). Read the ADODB manual, and visit the 
php.weblogs.com Web site.
