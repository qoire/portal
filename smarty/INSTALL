REQUIREMENTS:

Smarty requires PHP 4.0.4pl1 or later to fix all known problems Smarty has with
PHP. Smarty was developed and tested with 4.0.4pl1. See the BUGS file for more
info.

Smarty uses the PEAR libraries for some of its error handling routines. PEAR
libraries come with the distribution of PHP. Be sure that the path to these
libraries is included in your php include_path. Unix users check
/usr/local/lib/php. Windows users check C:/php/pear.

INSTALLATION:

* copy the Smarty.class.php, Smarty.addons.php, Smarty_Compile.class.php and
  Config_File.class.php scripts to a directory that is in your PHP include_path,
  or set the SMARTY_DIR constant and put your class files in this directory.

* create a "templates" directory, "configs" directory and a "templates_c"
  directory, be sure to set the appropriate directory settings in Smarty for
  them. If they are located in the same directory as your application, they
  shouldn't need to be modified. Be sure the "templates_c" directory is
  writable by your web server user (usually nobody). chown nobody:nobody
  templates_c; chmod 700 templates_c You can also chmod 777 this directory, but
  be aware of security issues for multi-user systems.

* setup your php and template files. A good working example is included to get
  you started. Also see the QUICKSTART guide for some more examples.

* TECHNICAL NOTE: If you do not have access to the php.ini file, you can change
  non-server settings (such as your include_path) with the ini_set() command.
  example: ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php");
