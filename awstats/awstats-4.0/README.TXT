I - FEATURES AND REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------

I - 1) Features

	A full log analysis enables AWStats to show you the following information:
	* Number of VISITS and UNIQUE VISITORS, list of last visitors,
	* Days of week and rush hours (pages, hits, kb for each day and hour),
	* Domains/countries of hosts visitors (pages, hits, kb),
	* Authenticated users,
	* Most often pages viewed,
	* File types,
	* Web compression statistics (for mod_gzip),
	* Browsers used (pages, hits, kb for each browser),
	* OS used (pages, hits, kb for each OS),
	* VISITS OF ROBOTS,
	* SEARCH ENGINES, KEYPHRASES or KEYWORDS used to find your site,
	* HTTP errors (Page not found, ...).

	It supports the following features as well:
	* Can analyze all log formats.
	* Works from command line or as a CGI,
	* Update of statistics can be made on demand from the web interface and
	  not only from your scheduler,
	* Unlimited log file size, support splited log files,
	* Reverse DNS lookup during analysis,
	* A lot of options/filters can be defined,
	* Multi-named web sites supported (virtual servers),
	* Cross Site Scripting Attacks protection,
	* Several languages. English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German,
	  Polish, Greek, Czech, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean...
	* No need of extra perl libraries,
	* Look and colors can match your site design,
	* Help on how AWStats work, tooltips on HTML reporting page,
	* Easy to install, easy to use (No compilation, no extern databases),
	* Free (GNU GPL) and distributed with sources (perl script).


I - 2) Requirements

	To use AWStats CGI script, you need the following requirements:
	* Your Web server must be able to log web access in "NCSA combined logfile
	  format" like Apache or in "Extended W3C logfile format" like IIS 5.0+
	* You need to have read (better if read/write) access to your logfile
	  server. If you can have only a read access, for example with IIS that
	  doesn't allow write access on its lofgile, AWStats will automatically
	  work differently, but slower than with read/write access).
	* To run awstats, from command line, your operating system must be able to
	  run perl scripts (.pl files). To run awstats as a CGI (for real-time
	  statistics), your web server must also be able to run such scripts.
	  If not, you can solve this by downloading last Perl version at:
	  http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/ (Win32)
	  http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html (Unix/Linux/Other)
