<b><u>FAQ-ABO100 : WHICH WEB SERVER OR OS ARE SUPPORTED ?</u></b><br>
AWStats can works with all web server able to write log file with a <u>combined log format (XLF/ELF)</u> like apache,
a <u>common log format (CLF)</u> like Apache or Squid, an <u>W3C log format</u> like IIS 5.0 or higher (Some users have
reported that you can setup your log format to W3C with IIS 4.0 but you need a service pack 6), and a lot of others
Web/Wap/Proxy servers.<br>
Because AWStats is in perl, it can works on all Operating Systems.<br>
Examples of used platforms (bold means 'tested by author', others were reported by AWStats users to work correctly) :<br>

<a name="LOGFORMAT"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-ABO150 : WHICH LOG FORMAT CAN AWSTATS ANALYZE ?</u></b><br>
AWStats setup knows predefined log format you can use to make AWStats config easier. However,
you can define your own log format, that's the reason why AWStats can analyze nearly all web, wap
and proxy server log files. Some FTP servers are also supported.<br>
The only requirement is "Your log file must contain required information".<br>
This is example of possible log format:<br>
<i>
Apache combined log format (known as NCSA combined log format or XLF or ELF format) (See FAQ for this format)<br>
IIS 5.0+ log format (known as W3C format)<br>
Webstar native log format<br>
ProFTP server<br>
...<br>
Apache common log format (AWStats can now analyze such log files but such log files does not contain all information
AWStats is looking for. The problem is in the content, not in the format). I think analyzing common log files is not
interesting because there is a lot of missing information: no way to filter robots, find search engines, keywords, os, browser.
But a lot of users asked me for it, so AWStats support it. However, a lot of interesting advanced features can't work: browsers, os's, keywords, robot detection...).

<a name="LANG"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-ABO200 : WHICH LANGUAGES ARE AVAILABLE ?</u></b><br>
AWStats can make reports in 27 languages. This is a list of all of them, for last version, in alphabetical order:<br>

<b><u>FAQ-SET050 : ERROR "MISSING $ ON LOOP VARIABLE ..."</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font>
When I run awstats.pl from command line, I get:<br>
<i>"Missing $ on loop variable at awstats.pl line xxx"</i><br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
Problem is in your Perl interpreter. Try to install or reinstall a more recent/stable perl interpreter.<br>
You can get new Perl version at <a href="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a> (<font color=#221188>Win32</font>)
or <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html">Perl.com</a> (<font color=#221188>Unix/Linux/Other</font>).<br>
<br>

<a name="CGISOURCE"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET100 : I SEE PERL SCRIPT'S SOURCE INSTEAD OF ITS EXECUTION</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font>
When I try to execute the perl script through the web server,
I see the perl script's source instead of the HTML result page of its execution !<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
This is not a problem of AWStats but a problem in your web server setup.
awstats.pl file must be in a directory defined in your web server to be a "cgi" directory,
this means, a directory configured in your web server to contain "executable" files and
not to documents files.
You have to read your web server manual to know how to setup a directory to be an
"executable cgi" directory (With IIS, you have some checkbox to check in directory
properties, with apache you have to use the "ExecCGI" option in the directory "Directive").<br>
<br>

<a name="SPAWNERROR"></a><a name="INTERNAL"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET150 & FAQ-SET200 : INTERNAL ERROR OR ERROR 500 IN MY BROWSER</u></b><br>
<b><u>ERROR "... COULDN'T SPAWN CHILD PROCESS..." IN APACHE ERROR LOG</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font>
AWStats seems to run fine at the command prompt but when ran as a CGI from a browser, I get an<br>
<i>"Internal Error"</i>.<br>
Sometimes I get the following message in my error log file:<br>
<i>[error] [client xx.xx.xx.xx] No such file or directory: couldn't spawn child process: c:/mywebroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl</i><br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
This problem occurs with Apache web server with no internal perl interpreter (mod_perl not
active). To solve this, you must tell Apache where is your perl interpreter. For this, you have 2 solutions:<br>
1) Change the first line of awstats.pl file with the full path of your perl interpreter.<br>
Example with Windows OS and ActivePerl perl interpreter (installed in C:\Program Files\ActivePerl),
you must change the first line of awstats.pl file with:<br>
<i>#!c:/program files/activeperl/bin/perl</i><br>
2) Other solution: Uncomment in your Apache httpd.conf config the following line (remove the # at the beginning)<br>
<i>ScriptInterpreterSource registry</i><br>
Then restart Apache. This will tell Apache to use the program associated to .pl extension in windows registry,
to find the perl interpreter.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-SET250 : LOG FORMAT SETUP OR ERRORS</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> Which value do I have to put in the LogFormat
parameter to make AWStats working with my log file format ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
The AWStats config file give you all possible values for LogFormat parameter.

<a name="FTP"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET260 : SETUP FOR FTP SERVER LOG FILES</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> What do I have to do to use AWStats to analyze some FTP server log files.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
AWStats was built to analyze web,wap or proxy server's log files. However it can be used with some FTP server log files.<br>
<u>This is example for ProFTP:</u><br>
Modify the proftpd.conf file. At the very top add two new defines.<br>
<i>LogFormat awstats "%t %h %u GET %f 200 %b"<br>
ExtendedLog /var/log/xferlog read,write awstats</i><br>
Turn off Transfer log (optional)<br>
<i>TransferLog none</i><br>
Copy config awstats.conf file to "awstats.proftp.conf".<br>
Modify this new config file:<br>
<i>LogFile="/var/log/xferlog"<br>
LogFormat="%time1 %host %logname %method %url %code %bytesd"<br>
DNSLookup=0</i><br>
ShowLinksOnUrl=0<br>
ShowAuthenticatedUsers=1<br>
Warning: This tip doesn't work for FTPed files that contains spaces in them (they are not reported). You can still convert your
log file to replace 'space' char into '_'...<br>
<br>

<a name="NOTSAMENUMBER"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET280 : ERROR "NOT SAME NUMBER OF RECORDS OF..."</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> When I run AWStats from command line (or as a cgi from a browser), I get
a message "Not same number of records of ...".<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
This means your AWStats reference database files (operating systems, browsers, robots...) are not correct.
Check in your disk that you have only ONE of those files (They should be in 'db' directory where awstats.pl is installed):<br>
<i>browsers.pl</i><br>
<i>operating_systems.pl</i><br>
<i>robots.pl</i><br>
<i>domains.pl</i><br>
<i>search_engines.pl</i><br>
<br>

<a name="COULDNOTOPEN"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET300 : ERROR "COULDN'T OPEN FILE ..."</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I have the following error:<br>
<i>"Couldn't open file /workingpath/awstatsmmyyyy.tmp.9999: Permission denied."</i><br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> This error means that the web server 
didn't succeed in writing the working temporary file (file ended by .tmp.9999 
where 9999 is a number) because of permissions problems.<br>
First check that the directory <i>/workingpath</i> has "Write" permission for<br>
user <u>nobody</u> (default user used by apache on Linux systems)<br>
or user <u>IUSR_<i>SERVERNAME</i></u> (default used user by IIS on NT).<br>
With Unix, try with a path with no links.<br>
With NT, you must check NTFS permissions ("Read/Write/Modify"), if your directory is on a NTFS partition.<br>
With IIS, there is also a "Write" permission attribute, defined in directory properties 
in your IIS setup, that you must check.<br>
With IIS, if a default cgi-bin directory was created during IIS install, try to 
put AWStats directly into this directory.<br>
If this still fails, you can change the DirData parameter to say AWStats 
that you want to use another directory (A directory you are sure that the default 
user, used by web server process, can write into).<br>
<br>

<a name="EMPTY_STATS"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET350 : EMPTY OR NULL STATISTICS REPORTED</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> AWStats seems to work but I'm not 
getting any results. i get a statistics page that looks like i have no hits.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> That's the most common problem you 
can have and reason is simple: Your log file format setup is wrong.<br>
<u>If you use Apache web server</u><br>
The best way of working is to use the <i>"combined"</i> log format (See into the <b>README.TXT</b> file
to know the way to change your apache server log from <i>"common"</i> log format into <i>"combined"</i>).
Don't forget to stop apache, reset your log file and restart Apache to make change into combined
effective. Then you must setup your AWStats config file with value <i>LogFormat=1</i>.<br>
If you want to use another format, read the next FAQ to have examples of LogFile value according
to log files format.<br>
<u>If you use IIS server or Windows built-in web server</u><br>
The Internet Information Server default W3C Extended Log Format will not work correctly with AWStats.
To make it work correctly, start the IIS Snap-in, select the web site and look at it's Properties.
Choose W3C Extended Log Format, then Properties, then the Tab Extended Properties and uncheck everything
under Extended Properties. Once they are all unchecked, check off the list in the ReadMe file in the
IIS section, "With IIS Server".
You can also read the next FAQ to have examples of LogFormat value according to log files format.<br>

<a name="NO_ICON"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET450 : NO PICTURES/GRAPHICS SHOWN</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> AWStats seems to work (all data and counters seem to be good)
but I have no image shown.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> With Apache web server, you might have
troubles (no picture shown on stats page) if you use a directory called "icons" (because of Apache
pre-defined "icons" alias directory), so use instead, for example, a directory called "icon"  with
no s at the end (Rename your directory physically and change the DirIcons parameter in config file
to reflect this change).<br>
<br>

<a name="CRONTAB"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET550 : HOW TO RUN AWSTATS FREQUENTLY</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> AWStats must be ran frequently to update statistics.
How can I do this ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font><br>
<u>With Windows</u>, you can use the internal task scheduler.
The use of this tool is not an AWStats related problem, so please take a look at your Windows manual.
Warning, if you use <i>"awstats.pl -config=mysite -update"</i> in your scheduled task, you might
experience problem of failing task. Try this instead<br>
<i>"C:\WINNT\system32\CMD.EXE /C C:\[awstats_path]\awstats.pl -config=mysite -update"</i><br>
or<br>
<i>"C:\[perl_path]\perl.exe C:\[awstats_path]\awstats.pl -config=mysite -update"</i><br>
A lot of other scheduler (sharewares/freewares) are very good.<br>
<u>With unix-like operating systems</u>, you can use the "crontab".<br>
This is examples of lines you can add in the cron file (see your unix reference manual for cron) :<br>
To run update every day at 04:00, use :<br>
<i>0 4 * * * /opt/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -config=mysite -update</i><br>
To run update every hour, use :<br>
<i>0 * * * * /opt/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -config=mysite -update</i><br>
<br>

<a name="EXCLUDEHOSTS"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-SET600 : HOW CAN I EXCLUDE MY IP ADDRESS (OR WHOLE SUBNET MASK) FROM STATS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I don't want to see my own IP address in the stats or I want to exclude counting
visits from a whole subnet.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font><br>
You must edit the config file to change the SkipHosts parameter.<br>
For example, to exclude:<br>
- your own IP address 123.123.123.123, use SkipHosts="123.123.123.123"<br>
- the whole subnet 123.123.123.xxx, use SkipHosts="123.123.123"<br>
- all sub hosts xxx.myintranet.com, use SkipHosts=".myintranet.com" (This one works only if DNS lookup is already done in your
log file).<br>

<a name="SPEED"></a><br>
<b><u>FAQ-COM100 : AWSTATS SPEED/TIMEOUT PROBLEMS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> When I analyze large log files,
processing times are very important (Update process from a browser
returns a timeout/internal error after a long wait).
Is there a setup or things to do to avoid this and increase speed ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> Yes. You really need to understand 
how a log analyzer works to have good speed. There is also major setup changes 
you can do to decrease your processing time.<br>
- Launch AWStats more often (from crontab or a scheduler). More often you launch 
AWStats, more faster is AWStats (because the less is the number of NEW lines in 
log, since last run, to process). See the <a href="awstats_benchmark.html">Benchmark page</a> to
get examples of launching frequency according to your web traffic<br>
- You can disable <i>DNSLookup</i> in configure file (set <i>DNSLookup=0</i>) 
<u>but this requires absolutely that hosts addresses in your log file are already 
resolved</u> (need to setup your web server to do so). Speed can be increased 
up by <b>2 to 50</b> times !<br>
If you don't understand what is an "already resolved reverse DNS lookup", keep 
this parameter to 1.<br>
- If you use Apache, set <i>PurgeLogFile</i> to 1 (By default, to avoid bad surprise, 
<i>PurgeLogFile</i> is 0 in configure file, but you can set it to 1 to ask AWStats 
to purge the log file after processing it. This increase speed for next run).<br>
- Use last AWStats version.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM200 : HOW REVERSE DNS LOOKUP WORKS, UNRESOLVED IP ADDRESSES</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> The reported page AWStats shows me 
has no hostnames, only IP addresses, countries reported are all "unknown".<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> When AWStats find an IP address 
in your log file, it tries a reverse DNS lookup to find the hostname and domain 
if the <i>DNSLookup</i> parameter, in your AWStats config file, is <i>DNSLookup=1</i> 
(Default value). So, first, check if you have the good value. The <i>DNSLookup=0</i> 
must be used only if your log file contains already resolved IP address. For example, 
when you set up Apache with the <i>HostNameLookups=on</i> directive. When you 
ask your web server to make itself the reverse DNS lookup to log hostname instead 
of IP address, you will still find some IP addresses in your log file because 
the reverse DNS lookup is not always possible. But if your web server fails in 
it, AWStats will also fails (All reverse DNS lookups use the same system API). 
So to avoid AWStats to make an already done lookup (with success or not), you 
can set <i>DNSLookup=0</i> in AWStats config file. Since 2.23, because a lot of users
don't know this option, when AWStats find an already resolved IP Address in your log 
file, it disables itself the reverse DNS lookup because it means that reverse lookup 
is already done in log file. If IIS or Apache has made one DNS lookup resolution 
for one record in your log file, they must have done it for all the file. If 
you find only few lines with hostnames and others with IP Address, it means your 
web server failed in resolving them. Check your DNS reverse system with the <i>nslookup</i> 
command (available on NT/2000 and Unix).<br>
Apache users might be interesting in knowing there is a tool called <i>logresolve</i> with
Apache distribution, that can convert a logfile with IP Addresses into a logfile with resolved hostnames.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM250 : DIFFERENT RESULTS THAN OTHER ANALYZER</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I also use webalizer (or another 
log analyzer) and it doesn't report the same results than AWStats. Why ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font>
If you compare AWStats results with an other log file analyzer, you will found some differences,
sometimes very important. In fact, all analyzer (even AWStats) make "over reporting" because of the
problem of proxy-servers and robots. However AWStats is one the most accurate and its "over reporting"
is very low where all other analyzers, even the most famous, have a very high error rate (10% to 2x more than reality).<br>
This is the most important reasons why you will find differences:<br>
- Some dynamic pages generated by CGI programs are not counted by some analyzer (ie Webalizer) like
a "Page" (but only like a "Hit") if CGI prog has not a .cgi extension, so they are not included
correctly in their statistics. AWStats does not make this error and all CGI pages are pages.<br>
- AWStats is the alone analyzer (that i know for the moment) able to detect robots visits.
All other analyzers think it's a human visitor. This error make them to report more visits and visitors
than reality. This does not happen with AWStats. When it tells "1 visitor", it means "1 human visitor".
All robots hits are reported in the "Robots/Spiders visitors" chart.<br>
- A lot of analyzer (ie webalizer) use the "Hits" to count visitors. This is not a good way of working :
Some visitors use a lot of proxy servers to surf (ie: AOL users), this means it's possible that several
hosts (with several IP addresses) are used to reach your site for only one visitor (ie: one proxy server download
the page and 2 other servers download all images). Because of this, if stats of unique visitors are made on "hits",
3 users are reported but it's wrong. So AWStats, like HitBox, considers only HTML "Pages" to count unique visitors.
This decrease the error, not completely, because it's always possible that a proxy server download one HTML frame and
another one download another frame, but this make the over-reporting of unique visitors less important.<br>
There is also differences in log analyzers databases and algorithms that make details of results less or more accurate:<br>
- AWStats has a larger browser, os and search engine database, so reports concerning this are more accurate.<br>
- AWStats has url syntax rules to find keywords or keyphrases used to find your site, but AWStats has also
an algorithm to detect keywords of unknown search engines with unknown url syntax rule.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM300 : DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOCAL HOURS AND AWSTATS REPORTED HOURS</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I use IIS and there's a difference 
between local hour and AWStats reported hour. For example I made a hit on a page 
at 4:00 and AWStats report I hit it at 2:00.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> This is not a problem of time 
in your local client host. AWStats use only time reported in logs by your server 
and all time are related to server hour. The problem is that IIS in some foreign 
versions puts GMT time in its log file (and not local time). So, you have also 
GMT time in your statistics.<br>
You can do nothing, for the moment, but waiting that Microsoft change this in next
IIS versions. However, Microsoft sheet Q271196 "IIS Log File Entries 
Have the Incorrect Date and Time Stamp" says: <br>
<i>The selected log file format is the W3C Extended Log File 
Format. The extended log file format is defined in the W3C 
Working Draft WD-logfile-960323 specification by Phillip 
M. Hallam-Baker and Brian Behlendorf. This document defines 
the Date and Time files to always be in GMT. This behavior 
is by design.</i><br>
So this means this way of working might never be changed.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM350 : HOW CAN I PROCESS OLD LOG FILE ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I want to process an old log file to include its data in my AWStats reports.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
You must change your LogFile parameter to point to the old log file and run the update. However the update process can only accept
files in chronological order, so if you have already processed a recent file, you must before
reset all your statistics (see next FAQ) and restart all the update process for all past log files and in chronological order.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM400 : HOW CAN I UPDATE MY STATISTICS WHEN I USE A LOAD BALANCING SYSTEM THAT SPLITS MY LOGS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> How can I update my statistics when i use a load balancing system that split my logs ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
The best solution is to merge all split log files resulted from all your load balanced servers into one. For this, you can use
the <b>logresolvemerge</b> tool provided with AWStats since version 3.2 :<br>
<i>logresolvemerge.pl file1.log file2.log ... filen.log > newfiletoprocess.log</i><br>
And setup the <i>LogFile</i> parameter in your config file to process the <i>newfiletoprocess.log</i> file.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM500 : HOW CAN I RESET ALL MY STATISTICS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> I want to reset all my statistics and restart my stats from now.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
All analyzed data are stored by AWStats in files called awstatsMMYYYY.[site.]txt (one file each month).
You will find those files in directory defined by "DirData" parameter (same directory than awstats.pl by default).<br>
To reset your stats for a month, you just have to delete the file for the required month/year.<br>
To reset all your stats, delete all files awstats*.txt<br>
Warning, if you delete those data files, you won't be able to recover your stats back, unless you kept old log files somewhere.
You will have to process all past log files (in chronological order) to get old statistics back.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-COM550 : CAN I SAFELY REMOVE A LINE IN HISTORY FILES (awstatsMMYYYY*.txt) ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> After processing a log file I want to change my statistics
without running AWStats update process but changing directly data in AWStats historical database files.<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
If you remove a lines starting with "BEGIN_" or "END_", AWStats will find your file "corrupted" so you must not change those
kind of lines. All lines that are not in any "section" (between a BEGIN_xxx and END_xxx line) should also not be removed.
However you can change any line that is a "section record", but you do this at your own risk. Your reported stats
might have wrong values after that.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-SEC00 : CAN AWSTATS BE USED TO MAKE CROSS SITE SCRIPTING ATTACKS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> If a bad user use a browser to make a hit on an URL that include a < SCRIPT > ... < /SCRIPT >
section in its parameter, when AWStats will show the links on the report page, does the script will be executed ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
No. AWStats use a filter to remove all scripts codes that was included in an URL to make a Cross Site Scripting Attack using a
log analyzer report page.<br>

<b><u>FAQ-SEC200 : HOW TO MANAGE LOG FILES (AND STATISTICS) CORRUPTED BY 'CODE RED VIRUS LIKE' ATTACKS ?</u></b><br>
<font style="color: #660000">PROBLEM:</font> My site is attacked by some Code Red Viruses. This make my log file corrupted
and full of 404 errors. So my statistics are also full of 404 errors. This make AWStats slower and my history files very large.
Can I do something to avoid this ?<br>
<font style="color: #4444cc">SOLUTION:</font> 
Yes.<br>
'Code Red virus like' attacks are infected browsers or robots that make hits on your site using a very long unknown URL
like this one (hoping your server is IIS):<br>
<i>/default.ida?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX%40%50...%40%50</i><br>
URL is generated by the infected robot and the purpose is to exploit a vulnerability of the web server (only IIS is concerned by Code Red worm).
So you will often find a 'common string' in those URLs. For example, with Code Red worm, there is always default.ida in the URL string.
So, you should edit your config file to add in the SkipFiles parameter the following value:<br>
<i>SkipFiles="default.ida"</i><br>
<br>
