INSERT INTO narrative VALUES (1,9,'PROLOGUE','I\'ve always been something of a loner. That\'s why I volunteered for the mission. Yet this empty world below scared me.\r\nWe came in over Florida. By now I knew this had to be Earth. The broad facilities of Canaveral were nothing more than a grassy field, but the outlines were there, and the monuments of the early launch facilities seemed to be in good repair. Only after we landed could I see that their preservation was less than perfect.\r\nI walked around, poking into the few remaining buildings. All were empty and silent. Gulls circled overhead, small animals moved in the underbrush at the edge of the meadow; birds sang. I found a terminal of unknown design in a building. Nearby was a small cap with the words \"Mindlink XV3-2044.\" I put it on but nothing happened. The terminal was inactive and I could find no way to change that. It had no screen, no keyboard, only what I took to be a holographic projection platform and this cap. I\'m not even sure it was a terminal.\r\nGyges  (gye´jeez) has been remarkably little help. All her expert systems, all her powerful AI functions, seemed helpless, so I asked her to go over ship\'s log.\r\nOur trajectory went according to program. We approached 87.79% lightspeed within the first five years subjective travel. Then something interrupted the program. Gyges is unable to analyze what. A  broad swatch of datastorage seems to be wiped. A proton flux? Magnetic anomaly? The Scoop performed according to design. Speed increased to 93.45% C, then to 94, 95, 96, 97. Time dilation began to affect the circuits in ways Gyges could not determine.\r\nWe never reached 61 Cygni.\r\nI listen to audible representations. Mostly it is the hiss of high speed data, the shrill chatter of bits flowing in the superconducting circuits. Why do I do this? I do not know. There is nothing else to do.\r\nOnce I thought I heard something. I asked for slower and slower replays. I tried filtering and modulating the sounds. It was almost like music, a chant or patterned polyphony. I moved the frequency up and down.\r\nI heard what I thought must be a name: Peter Devore.\r\nI must have been mistaken, yet the name was there, hidden in the chittering data, clearly enunciated. I listened to it over and over again. Then I went outside again.\r\nIt was a warm spring day. A light breeze came in from the ocean. The air was clean and bracing with salt and ozone. It was so very like the day I had left this field for Alice Springs (how many years ago?) that I felt a strange sense of disorientation. It was as if, for me, everyone and everything familiar had vanished overnight.\r\nGyges sampled all available frequencies, all available channels.\r\nThere was no one in the world, so I lifted the ship and moved slowly over the face of the earth, looking for...I do not know what I was looking for.\r\nWhere Washington D.C. once sprawled beside the Potomac (only yesterday!) was a scattered parkland with ancient monuments: the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the Capitol building. The Pentagon was just an outline, a pentagonal berm covered with grass.\r\nIn the Library of Congress building I found a map called Intercorp World Administrative Regions Archival Hardcopy, with a date: August 14, 2077. The map includes what appears to be an organizational chart for the Intercorp Council.\r\nI don\'t recognize any names. But I found also an outline of twenty-first century history. My own departure is listed for 2004. Monday, May 24. One of the first hypersonic salt-cycle suborbitals took me up the Gyges scoop.  It\'s all there. The newsnets at the time carried live coverage of the scoop going operational. By the time I\'d left Mars orbit I was all but forgotten. So many other things seemed to be happening in the world.\r\nIn the entry for Thursday, February 5, 2076. \"Gyges 61 Cygni single man explorer telemetry ceased as of this date. Signal attenuation indicates system shutdown. Presumed lost.\"\r\nThat\'s all. \"Presumed lost.\" No effort to understand what happened.','datacrystalfailure.gif','1/4',20020414162510,1,0),(2,9,'PROLOGUE','I had no idea how much time had passed, of course. When the ship revived me 200 million kilometers out, I was disoriented and puzzled. Later, when we swept in over the South Atlantic on our first orbit, I grew alarmed.\r\nThis was certainly not the world I left, although the general geography was familiar. There was the hooked circle of Antarctica, the western hemisphere, the broad bulge of Siberia and the Arctic ice cap, but where were the cities? Where was the constant communications chatter? Where were the signs of traffic and human life? The planet I was orbiting was empty.\r\nYet the system was the same. The LP-5 colonies still hovered at their Legrange points, but they too were silent. The moon circled overhead, but no voices came out of the Lunar bases. The geosyncs and relay satellites had certainly multiplied since I\\\'d been gone, but nothing but unmodulated carrier waves moved between them.\r\nIt seems yesterday I was laid into the complex hum of the first cryofield aboard the Gyges and put to sleep. For me, it was yesterday, yet years have passed. I should have revived in orbit off 61 Cygni and spent a year observing the double star.\r\nThis did not happen.\r\nGyges held me, my cryofield, and the most advanced artificial intelligence computer the Intercorp scientists could produce in the early 21st. She spoke and understood standard natural-language English. She contained the intuitive and deductive skills of countless experts in celestial navigation, the physical and biological sciences, life support, entertainment and psychological adaptation. I anticipated no problems.\r\nBut I awoke (it seemed) moments after I had gone into the cryofield 200 million kilometers from earth, inward bound, and everything has changed.','datacrystalfailure.gif','2/4',20020414162522,2,0),(3,9,'PROLOGUE','Manhattan is a monument. The triangular mile-high pyramids of midtown still stand, but they are empty. A cold wind was blowing. The lower East Side is now a vast field littered with abandoned vehicles of types I have never seen. Some of them have been open to the seasons for years. Brambles have grown over the seats, through the steering columns (at least I think that\'s what those whiplike extensions from just below the lefthand window must be).\r\nThen, early in June, I found an entrance.\r\nEveryone had moved underground. Of course that movement had begun before I left, but I had no idea it would be so extensive. The world has been reforested.\r\nIt is very beautiful, but there is no one to talk to. I am the last person left alive.\r\nUnderground is nothing but desolation. Endless corridors where my footsteps echo. Condensation collects and runs down the walls. Occasionally a gust of air shows some random action of the atmosphere controls, so somewhere there is still power, but I have yet to find a machine or terminal that works. Not that I would understand how to work them even if they were active. The lifts do not work and I have had to climb access ladders or stairs.\r\nThere is no sign of violence. It is as if everyone had stepped out years ago and not returned.\r\nThe Gyges works very well on the planetary surface. (Naturally I left the scoop in orbit.) She was designed to be rugged and intelligent. She sang to me as we flew over what was once the eastern United States (recently called, from the chart, the \"Northwest Alliance.\") Nothing exists but trees, as far as I can see, as far as Gyges\' sensors can scan: trees and rolling hills. This used to be called Pennsylvania when I left, and this was Ohio. The Lakes gleam to the north, pale and blue.\r\nI landed south of Chicago. The Loop is enclosed in a dome, the old 20th Century buildings perfectly preserved. Everywhere else there is nothing but forest and meadow, river and lake.\r\nI walked into old Chicago. The access lock to the dome stood open. Ancient computer printout littered the street. Soon I found what looked like an escalator, frozen forever, going down. I found a hospital on the first level. There were bodies in some of the beds. This is the first sign of human beings I have found.\r\nThe bodies were mummified inside lifesupport tents. They had certainly been dead for years, and there were not many of them. I sat beside one of them for hours. I do not know what happened to them, what terrible disease they had or why they were abandoned here in lifesupport which no longer functioned.\r\nAt what seems to have been a nurse\'s station on the second level, I found a terminal with a small ready light burning. It might allow me to search for information. I will try to find out what has happened to the world, where the people have gone, and if I must remain alone for the rest of my life.\r\nGyges tells me my psychological adjustment is in peril. I have been too long without other people.','datacrystalfailure.gif','3/4',20020417190347,3,0),(4,9,'PROLOGUE','Besides this level of the hospital, the second level consists of  many small rooms, some with desks holding ancient, illegible hardcopy, curled and yellow, the paper itself so brittle it fragmented when I breathed near it. Dust had collected in odd patterns, not evenly distributed, but piled against walls and corners, waved like sand dunes across surfaces, apparently blown away in other places. As I walked the dust puffed up behind me and fell slowly back, swirling in the even glow from panels set into the walls and ceiling which clearly imitated sunlight. The effect was beyond desolation, and I found myself hurrying back to the nurse\\\'s station and the terminal.\r\nIt didn\\\'t occur to me to be surprised about the presence of power. Here the diffuse glow of lighting seemed natural. Somewhere, I realized, a power station still worked. Were people operating them, or was this all automatic?\r\nI looked at the terminal. The ready light, or what I assumed was a ready light because that\\\'s what it would have been in the beginning of the 21st century, was an intense emerald green, very clear. It seemed to beckon me, to tell me that answers lay inside.\r\nIn a drawer I found a printed pamphlet:\r\n\r\nWORLDNET\r\n\r\nEmergency Operating Instructions\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneva Node Ref. #1347-030Alpha\r\nFiber Media Update November 11, 2088.\r\n\r\n\r\n••• Warning •••\r\n\r\nThis document is NOT intended as a full explanation of Worldnet capabilities or usage.  It is for emergency use only.  For Edmod Neurotransfer contact your Local Node Edmod AI.\r\n\r\n••• Warning •••\r\n\r\nAfter the table of contents I read:\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\nIn event of catastrophic failure of neural I/O peripherals, this fiber media printout is designed to help any citizen enter Worldnet dataspace.\r\nSuch catastrophic failure might include:\r\n•  medical emergency with both personal monitor and mindlink failure;  \r\n•  new viral intrusion into essential grown organic picoelectronics;  \r\n•  deliberate or accidental sabotage of Local Node housing or traffic AI;  \r\n•  a single-strand remote terminal or portable datapad suffering catastrophic I/O detuning;\r\n•  induced madness in a local AI;\r\n•  drastic power loss to Local Node.\r\nWhile Geneva Node (Central Processing Artificial Intelligence) considers these possibilities extremely remote (< one in one billion), Intercorp Council orders these emergency instructions centrally available in hardcopy form in all Urb warrens, outposts, museum or monument structures, medical support chambers and Local Node housings.\r\nThis document is intended for emergency support only.  If no emergency exists, route questions to Geneva Node via Local Node through standard mindlink or phonic channels.\r\n\r\nThere was much here I did not understand. As at Canaveral, I could see no screen, but there was a keyboard. It was extremely light, yet when I touched an oval depression on the side it froze in place, even though it was not in contact with a solid surface. I pressed the oval again, and the keyboard was free to move. The chair operated the same way.\r\nBesides the standard alphanumeric was a row of special keys marked with icons, small pictures I could not immediately identify.\r\nI was afraid. Despite the operating instructions, all this equipment was strange. I walked the hallways from room to room for some time, reluctant to try activating the terminal. But each time I returned to the nurse\\\'s station the ready light glowed steadily, beckoning.\r\nThere is no one else here, besides the mummified bodies.\r\nThe nurse\\\'s station is circular and filled with strange equipment. The lifesupport tents radiate out from it in a near-complete circle. The door, and a small stage, take up the remaining wedge of the circle.\r\nI stared at the keys. The small pictures. One looked like a cross-section of a human brain. I\\\'d seen the same image at Canaveral, on the Mindlink XV3-2044, but I could find no small cap here to put on.\r\nI sat down finally, unable to put it off any longer. I set the keyboard at a comfortable height; the light dimmed, but I did not notice. Very swiftly the terminal seemed to be checking itself. Images flared and faded so quickly I could not tell what they were-only the vague impression of peripherals like mindlink or holographics. There was a bright red flash, then these words spoken in a strangely androgynous voice: \"Welcome to Chicago Node. You have logged on to Worldnet. Prepare for Realtime Mindlink Data transfer.\" After a pause, the voice went on. \"Your retina is not on file. Mindlink is inoperative.\" I had the impression of a group of people speaking among themselves, then the voice, louder now, returned. \"Thank you. You will now enter Worldnet Dataspace.\"\r\nThe figure of a man appeared some distance away. Certain for a moment I had found another person, I stood up, forgetting that the keyboard was locked in place, pinning me in the chair. Then I noticed the figure was incomplete, translucent in places. From time to time the head (which I saw had no discernable features) fragmented and coalesced.\r\nI heard the same androgynous voice. \"Welcome to Chicago Local Node. Chilink has notified Geneva of your presence.\"\r\n\"What\'s happened?\" I asked. \"Where is everyone?\"\r\nThere was no answer. The figure broke up again, came back together.\r\nFinally I tried typing the question on the keyboard.\r\nThe head lifted, as though listening, and the voice answered me. \"We do not understand. One moment, please.\" The projection vanished abruptly, as if switched off, and I looked at the empty wall of the nurse\'s station. I felt as if I had been seeing ghosts.\r\nAfter a few moments, the figure reappeared. \"We are sorry. Many systems in our network have decayed.  At one time we had over seventeen billion active terminals, including biomonitors and satellite links, but we have not had an active terminal for over twelve years. We cannot hear you. We have sent a routine maintenance query to Geneva Node. Local diagnostics should arrive soon for repairs. Meanwhile we suggest you contact HOMER Artificial Intelligence for narrative reconstruction. Perhaps HOMER can help you.\" The figure vanished again.\r\nThe manual told me I should be able to enter doorways for information of the kinds of data contained inside:  Military, History, Science and Technology, Genealogical, Life Support (provided by information from so-called Personal Monitors worn by every citizen), Medical, Psychological, Geographical, Central Processing and something called PsiLink, which gives data on Psychic Sciences and is proscribed - entry is forbidden. And of course HOMER.\r\nI didn\'t understand. I had seen no doorways. I ate some of the rations I had brought from the Gyges, and adjusted the keyboard.\r\nAgain the lights dimmed, and again the figure appeared. We went through the same sequence. My retina was still not on file. I was still welcome to Chicago Local Node. Mindlink was still inoperative.\r\nThis time the figure did not vanish at the end, however. It said, \"Local node diagnostics have arrived. Chilink is unable to contact Geneva. We suggest you request hardcopy dataspace retrieval of all Worldnet interactions for audit, maintenance and archival purposes; we suggest filename \'Portal.\'\"\r\n\"Why don\'t you request it?\" I asked.\r\n\"We have no authority,\" the figure answered. \"We are a limited local node AI.\"\r\nGyges would not have given me this much trouble.\r\nSo I requested a hardcopy dataspace retrieval. \r\nThe figure said: \"Place your palm on the biomonitor sampler, please.\"\r\nI had no idea what it meant, and spent something over an hour looking for the biomonitor sampler. Finally I found what looked like a hot plate. When I put my palm on it (perhaps the hundredth thing I had placed my hand on!), it hummed for a moment and a yellow light flashed twice. When I returned to the terminal again, the figure thanked me.\r\nLater I learned that Central Processing could supply a textual version of all Worldnet entries, and record an audit trail of human interactions and activities. I will combine this retrieval with my recorded vocal commentary and store it via Gyges ramscoop telemetry with the on board AI.\r\nWhat follows will be my experience once I enter Worldnet.\r\n\r\nWORLDNET DATASPACE ENTRY\r\nHARDCOPY DATASPACE RETRIEVAL\r\nAUDIT TRAIL\r\nSUBJECT DNA#123671278BR77 (SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION PENDING LIFESUPPORT ANALYSIS OF BIOPSY MATERIAL)','datacrystalfailure.gif','4/4',20020414162206,4,0),(5,9,'Day 1: June 1, 2106','Before me shimmered an alphanumeric message:\r\n\r\nLocal Node Reports:\r\nUnterminated transit query at\r\n	Central Processing\r\nSystem Check Monitors request:\r\n	Transit query termination.\r\n\r\nI had no idea what an unterminated transit query was. The message faded, replaced by a set of twelve doors, all different colors, and each marked with an icon, none of which resembled those on the keys. One was marked with an interlocked C and P, which I judged must stand for Central Processing. I examined the door (really a box or cube hanging in space, but somehow it felt like a door). I could see no way to enter.\r\nI pressed the key with the brain icon.\r\nThe figure appeared in front of the doors and said, \"We regret that mindlink remains inoperative at this time. Local Node diagnostics are working on the problem. To enter a dataspace, please look at the desired doorway and press the key marked with the datacrystal icon.\"\r\nOf the four keys, only one even remotely resembled a crystal, so I looked at the CP doorway and pressed it.\r\n CENTRAL PROCESSING opened swiftly, exposing a room of shifting shades of yellow and gold, empty. Then a table (no, not a table - a flat horizontal surface) appeared. On it were three objects. They reminded me of mayonnaise jars, squat cylinders of a brilliant blue. I couldn\'t think of anything else to do, so I looked at the one closest to me (labeled in hanging text, \"PRIORITY THREE MESSAGE: CCNode\") and pressed the key again.\r\nThe figure reappeared. \"We regret the loss of vision and voice data from data storage modules. At the present time all information is textual. Local Node diagnostics are working on the problem.

Suddenly the mindlink went crazy; it seemed a system override was under way, shorting out my link. It hit my hippocampus pretty hard, because I started confabulating - a glowing tunnel, lights in the sky, a boy hunched over a console, walking through a meadow wet with dew - a series of random but intensely real images that took over awareness.

I asked, What is this Migration? I\'m only a Veterinary Technician. The Council does not consult me. I found hints in some of the nearby restricted zones in SciTech.

Longevity treatments were widespread around the same time, allowing for a life expectancy of 114.3 years. \r\nUnfortunately, a new series of disorders appeared under the general title of genetic diseases.

In effect, they were psychic diseases, small emotional or psychological rearrangements of the DNA, a cascade effect.\r\nWith the introduction of neurophage weapons, some transient genetic disorders appeared, though the effects were, at first, time-limited.

There was something wistful about his fantasies of a grandmother he never met, though.\r\nThen, too, there were the stories - family stories of strange events (a hundred years earlier they would have been far stranger): out of body experiences, precognitive dreams, sudden onsets of total empathy.

Not genderless, but too fully gendered. \"I\'d been unisex four years, with dreams, oh, the dreams, sometimes the man over me, I underneath as I remembered it, other times myself protecting as if a fighter in the African wars I remembered from my childhood, or lusting.

The satellites couldn\'t see them well, ice baffled the infrareds, and the coverage was patchy. That\'s what the newsnets told us.

Procedures had altered.\r\nIt was 1543H, July 22, an ordinary summer day, but for the presence of these two humans where they should not be. The duelists, a forty-two year old female challenged by her thirty-seven year old former lover, were both black belts in at least two martial arts, and accomplished with NP weapons.\r\nThey had entered Springfield Park from opposite corners with no expectation of finding other humans present. While duelling was common, most duels took place in special warren chambers; it was relatively rare to find a pair reserving a park. But these were shodan, black belt holders, and their animosity was great, so Central Processing gave them the park.\r\nThe female moved through the undergrowth, her dark ninja hood pulled up. She\'d had keratin manipulation, and wore a crest of scarlet of feathers instead of hair. The male had been attracted to her display, and the subtle control she had over the crest. Such displays were meant to attract in such a sexually competitive society. Now, though, she did not want to be seen.\r\nShe moved into a grove of beech trees as the shadow of a cumulus cloud flew across the ground. The movement of shadow covered her own into the grove, but the male, approaching from the south, saw and moved swiftly to keep her in view. Meanwhile, the man with the hoe continued his gardening off to the male\'s right, uninterrupted and unaware.\r\nThe air grew chill under the cloud, an abrupt and uncomfortable shift, and the female shivered enough to disturb the leaves. The male dropped to one knee, sighted along the range finder of his personal NP, and expressed the thought necessary to send an NP pulse.\r\nShe was shielded by the thick trunk, and warned by the distinctive humming subsonic buzz of NP. She melted back into the grove, maintaining a complex of tree trunks between herself and the male, yet luring him into the grove by offering small targets. Once deep inside, she lowered her hood and raised her crest, a sign of both attraction and danger.\r\nThe male apparently thought he had made a hit, for he moved with both carelessness and confidence. He hadn\'t abandoned all caution, of course, since to do so would be very foolish, and he was not a fool. A glancing shot would have meant rapid recovery, and he had to be sure.\r\nThe wind picked up and the humidity dropped. Peter had heard the NP buzz, and had certainly seen enough duels on holo, and been trained adequately by his Edmod in survival (he had the best available programming), so he moved more cautiously. Personal monitor records show he felt both fear and curiosity. He moved on toward the gardener as the female showed her crest. The male, poised at the edge of the grove and about to enter, stopped in surprise.\r\nShe fired then, but too hastily, and her pulse clipped a whitetail deer grazing on the first shoots from the gardener\'s beet row. The deer leaped once, walked for a moment in a dazed circle, then slowly collapsed, first onto its forelegs, then on its side. Ruminants have poor tolerance for NP weapons.\r\nPeter shouted as he began to run toward him. The male, thinking he was his opponent, turned and focused on Peter, presenting, as he did so, a broad target for the female. Their weapons discharged together, but of course Peter was in the open, and the eyes on the Springfield Tower could see him clearly. So Regent Sable saw him fall.\r\nThe female emerged from the grove and stood over the male, seated on the grass with a blank expression. \"Hello,\" he said.\r\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"Slime.\" She pointed her NP and discharged it directly into his frontals just above the left eye. This was the coup de grace, and Springfield Center immediately awarded her the win plus half his income until he recovered, a period of time under such circumstances likely to be quite lengthy. Her feathers flared in victory.\r\nPeter got up slowly and shook his head. The male\'s hit had clipped his ankle, knocking it out from under him and disorienting him briefly. The man with the hoe never looked up. Even when the female walked by on her way to NW Entry,  he continued his rhythmic movements, forward and back, forward and back, the hoe biting into the dark earth, down one row and up another, while Peter stood watching without moving.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,77,100),(76,11,'WAR, BURMA','March 2051.

But it made me think that we could do something with time, you see?\"\r\n\"No. You mean time travel?\"\r\n\"No, not time travel. More like collapsing time as if it were an accordion. It would make space kind of flat.... I contacted someone. Up here.\" Peter tapped his temple. \"I was asleep, Jimmy. Time does funny things in dreams, too. I started dreaming. I had control, of course - it was lucid dreaming. I was riding a huge white horse. I\'ve never seen a horse, but in the old optical disks they carried people. I was wearing armor, like in the middle ages. Not heavy armor, just a protective shirt. I was riding toward a castle.\" He shifted on the seat, looking toward the forest.\r\n\"Over there,\" he said. \"I was riding over there, toward a castle. I put the castle there, of course. I always liked those old stories. There was a lady in the castle, a prisoner. She didn\'t know where she was; it was dark and she couldn\'t feel anything. I heard her voice. She was singing a sad song, Jimmy. So sad. I said hello. I wasn\'t riding the horse any more, I was standing beside a window, a small opening in a stone wall. I couldn\'t see anything inside, it was so dark, but I could hear her singing. She stopped when I said hello. She answered, Jimmy. She said, \'Where are you?\'\r\n\"\'Springfield West,\' I answered. \'I think.\'\r\n\"\'Oh,\' she said. \'I\'m so cold. Can you...\' She stopped and I couldn\'t get her back. That\'s never happened in lucid dreaming; Jimmy. That\'s what makes lucid dreaming lucid, you can control where it goes. I had no control. It was as if I\'d contacted someone, a woman, and then lost the contact. I\'m going to try again tonight.\"\r\n\"Who is she?\" Jimmy asked softly.\r\nPeter looked at him. \"She\'s the Weaving Girl.\" He shook his head. \"I don\'t know who she is, really, but she\'s very far away.

Dreamleaf is the most often performed of all mozart works:\r\nIt began quietly, in darkness, as expected; after all, thematically it was a pastoral, and should begin with dawn. The sound was not quite audible, a tremulous shiver at the edge of the human auditory range, as if aspen leaves were trembling in the slightest breath of air. A sensation of floating grew steadily stronger as harmonics entered, expanded and contracted. Soon it was a rhythm these harmonics made, a slow, nearly imperceptible pulse which gradually coalesced into a two-part beat, one loud, the next soft, almost as if something were surging first forward, then back.\r\nIt became a heartbeat. The floating continued, but began to twist in place, as if turning head downward for a plunge into depths. A green so faint it was almost black emerged, developed a fine grain which grew coarser, details struggling to sharpen. The grain spread, grew fine again, and the green faded away, replaced by the deepest red, again nearly black. The gyrations slowed further, moving upright, as if the feet were dropping slowly toward some surface. The light grew brighter.\r\nThe soft heartbeat sounds began to syncopate; now there were two such sounds, beating not quite in synchrony with one another. Another motion overlay the gyration, a rhythmic rise and fall, as of tides moving through kelp; at the same time the colors too began to pulse, lighter and darker, like walking along a row of trees with the sun behind it, light to shadow to light again.\r\n(\"It\'s the womb,\" a woman said. \"Birth.\")\r\nIt was not. It was a dream of birth, a dream of the womb, dreamed out of Seemie\'s talent and experience. The colors faded again, the sound grew steadily louder, the heartbeats coming in and out of sync, the rise and fall, accelerating, as if the fetal audience was carried inside someone moving from a walk to a run.\r\nAn unfocused yellow grew, drew together, shaped a sphere, began to spin. From the spinning globe trails of yellow and orange and red curled off, left behind by the fury of that turning. The trails themselves fell into themselves, formed new spheres, made planets. Not real planets, surely, but the merest suggestion of planets, the yellow sphere making the merest hint of a sun.\r\nSomething obtruded on that sun, some shadow fell between the audience and that light, and when the shadow fell, a feeling of desolation, of yearning, replaced the floating.\r\nThere was a harsh melody then, dissonant and filled with despair; a melody with notes, phrases, intervals missing, loaded with subsonics.\r\nA light musical theme appeared underneath the heavy dissonance, a melodic trill. The shadow took on shape, became light green: an aspen leaf shivering against the sun. The melody gradually took over, dominated by high flute sounds, and something mellow, like an oboe. Tree trunks formed out of the darkness, the scene became an aspen grove on a mountainside. Strong sage-scent filled the air, a cool breeze moved. Suddenly it was dark again, as it was in the beginning. The heartbeats re-emerged, stronger now, with a cooler wind blowing.\r\nThen it was cold. Light grew, a gray light, a white light, harsh and demanding, heavy cloud light and harsh ice and snow light. The heartbeats became the sound of icy waters surging against a monstrous shelf of ice. Everyone would know this was Antarctica, the cruellest place on earth.\r\nA reptilian head appeared over the edge of the ice, a head with a gaping mouth filled with needle teeth. The head slid forward on an endless neck, followed at last by an enormous body, spotted and fast.\r\nThe light snapped out, and the sensation was of nightmare running, frozen panic. The cold cut deeper. Everything stopped: music, heartbeat, color shaping, sensation, everything. Silence was on the face of the void.\r\nOut of the silence the tension grew. Mouths opened to scream, but no sound came. There was nothing, absolute and without end.\r\nIt lasted until the heartbeats made their way into awareness, and with them the sudden understanding that they had been there all along. The  sensation was a landmark in the void, a fulcrum around which the world could form, out of which that tremulous shiver that had begun the piece could appear, a shiver that swelled from a distant slate blue light, slowly at first, then more swiftly, until it bore down with unimaginable intensity that did not pass, but grew and grew until the light swallowed everything and was replaced by darkness.','datacrystalfailure.gif','Re: Devore, Seemie Ref.67542@6',20020414170026,95,100),(93,4,'COMMENTARY 02062106@200117','After that night Peter found something like awe had crept into his attitude toward Seemie.

The Genetic Diversity Act of 2030 was still in force, but ethnic groups maintained hostilities in spite of it. Perhaps the Act made things worse; certainly the world had been on a homogenization trend for several decades before the Act passed the Council, a trend which the Act appeared to reverse.\r\nThe vendetta was registered in Cyprus. It was just one of thousands of registered vendettas that winter, monitored, regulated, and refereed by Central Processing. A Greek family named Nychtides had challenged a Turkish family named Chakalë on grounds of failure to pay bride price. In truth, the Turk had manipulated the database to squeeze out the Greek head of family from a lucrative managerial channel, and the bride-price failure was only the pro-forma excuse. Such things were common and quite legal, since minimal neurophage violence was considered a reasonable outlet and alternative to the kind of disaster the Burma War had been.\r\nThis time something was different. The Nychtides family had developed a twist on the NP weapon that did more that produce temporary disorientation; it induced, permanently, a new form of genetic disease, a complete loss of will. Med10 named it Genetic Aboulia Disorder, for a DNA-programmed loss of will.\r\nThe Chakalë family was quickly decimated. Unfortunately another Turk family took a hit, and declared a vendetta against the Nychtides, who retaliated in turn. Soon all Cyprus was in a state of siege, and the ENC cops were ineffective against this new weapon, which destroyed the first contingent sent in.\r\nNo shields were effective. The war spread rapidly to widely scattered outbreaks as families here and there acquired the new technology and used it to gain temporary advantage.

The Mind Wars were raging out of control on three continents. Human productivity was falling.\r\nBut the one worry that overshadowed all the others was Peter Devore. Regent was reasonably certain by then that Peter was his son, yet it was even more clear that Peter was a danger, that his particular genius was taking him into areas that would better be left alone for a number of significant reasons.\r\nIt was a genius Peter got from his mother - a woman who had been growing increasingly dangerous herself, her art tending as it had toward proscribed technologies.

Longevity technology was freely available, and barring genetic disease, a human could expect to live to at least 114.\r\nBut a widespread psychic technology would upset all that. Results were unpredictable, but CP had 87 percent confidence that consequences would be negative. So far, Regent had been able to prevent any significant growth of this technology. He\\\'d helped destroy PSYCHE back in \\\'52, and as far as he knew that was the end of it.

Proper robot inspection and comparison now indicates that this object is a meteorite from the ice near the Yamato Mountains.\r\nThe meteorite is of Martian origin which fell onto Antarctica some three million years ago. There is no doubt that Thatcher left this token of his homeland for us to find. Why else would he have carried it all the way from the South?\r\nThatcher showed it to Peter and the others. \"This,\" he said, \"is a fragment of Mars, fallen long ago onto the ice of the Antarctic plateau. The ice, which flows toward the sea at around seventy-five meters per year, ran into the Yamato Mountains not far from what was once the Japanese segment of Antarctica. The mountains forced the ice upwards; the ice ablated as it moved, evaporating until these stones were exposed. It should establish me as a representative of my society.\"\r\nPeter looked it over, the small fire-blackened lump of metal and dirt; it balanced in his hand like the egg of some small bird. \"It\'s come a long way,\" he said.\r\n\"Its history is its power,\" Thatcher agreed. \"We must keep such things in mind as we act. The universe is a bigger place than we sometimes think. Our understanding of it has grown exponentially the past two or three hundred years, but such times are nothing compared to what that object there has witnessed: a meteoric impact in the Argyre threw up fragments of the Martian surface. One small irregular chunk sailed for millions of years in interplanetary space until its orbit intersected that of the earth. It fell, melting from friction as it did, until it hit the ice near the South Pole. Over the centuries that followed ice and snow covered the stone, now round and blackened. The ice carried it until it returned once more to the surface where I picked it up and brought it here.\"\r\n\"Where will it go from here?\" Larin asked.\r\n\"Into this drawer,\" Peter said. \"Someday maybe it will be found.

I know there are endless forests to the horizon broken only by now-abandoned agricultural preserves. The wind began to tug and play, but swiftly the rain came, forcing me back into Gyges. \r\nMy ship holds rations for over a year, of course, since that was to be the duration of my stay in the vicinity of 61 Cygni. Still I wonder what I will do when my year is up. Those fields out there, the agricultural preserves, are empty. The automatic agricultural machinery is not working. Why should it? The earth is empty.\r\nI asked Gyges to scan all bands again, but of course there is still no human radio traffic in the solar system. This electromagnetic silence is stranger than the empty corridors of Chicago\\\'s warren. Gyges tells me, though, that there is more high-speed data traffic than there was a few days ago. The network is coming alive. She can sense laser, microwave, even fiberoptic traffic, but much of the technology has changed since she was built. Since she and I left for the stars.\r\nShe cannot enter. She has tried to make herself known to Worldnet, to Geneva Node, to Central Processing. They do not hear. Her technology is too old, obsolete. Her AI is too limited. She is a ghost in the world, invisible.\r\nLike myself. Except for my tenuous contact through Homer I too am a ghost, wandering the empty corridors, the silent world.\r\nOn the surface next to my ship I listened to the wind, to birds, to the cry of the coyote.\r\nThere were certainly no coyotes near Chicago when I left! I remember them only from my childhood in Idaho. The wind rose and soon drowned out their howling.\r\nI came inside and listened again to the tapes Gyges made for me; again I heard Peter\\\'s name. I still don\\\'t understand this.\r\nOn Gyges\\\' external video the storm lashed. Lightning flashes illuminated the glistening side of the dome. I see Gyges reflected there momentarily. I could use her sensors to learn a great deal about this planet, but what is the point? I was born here. It is already known.\r\nI\\\'d spent ten years training for the 61 Cygni mission, even before such a voyage was a remote dream. I\\\'d worked through college and graduate school in astrophysics (MIT) by the time I was twenty-two. Then I went to Intercorp\\\'s NASA division and suggested a ramscoop mission. With both the new cryofield technology and the axion ramscoop it was an obvious thing to do. Almost before I knew it they were packing me into the field.\r\nI don\\\'t know what to feel now. The mission I trained for failed. I have leaped over 100 years into my own future, and find it more empty and solitary than Gyges would ever have been orbiting another star. Then at least I would have known I would be returning to a world full of people, ready to welcome me as a hero.\r\nWe knew more real time than subjective time would pass, of course. The Lorentz-FitzGerald equations told us that long ago. But we couldn\\\'t predict how efficient the Gyges scoop would be, how close we would come to light speed, so we couldn\\\'t say how much time would pass. And since I was in the cryofield anyway, it didn\\\'t matter. We thought.\r\nBut too much time has passed, that is certain. Yet I am not sure, given the opportunity, that I would have wanted to live in Peter\\\'s world.\r\n\r\nThe storm still raged this morning as I made my way back into the city. I was soaked in the short time it took me to reach the dome. Inside the silence as I descended the frozen escalator was sudden, almost a physical blow.\r\nOnce more I walked the aisles. I began to think I should bury these people, put them away in the earth. There weren\\\'t many, just six in all; they would be light and not difficult to carry. Perhaps tomorrow.\r\nThe dust in unused corridors still mounded in those strange dune shapes, still rose and fell behind me. The rooms opened one into another. The walls were, as I had learned, configurable, though not without mechanical help. This warren no doubt changed from day to day when it was occupied. I counted seventeen levels down before I could go no farther.\r\nOn level fifteen I found a cabinet containing some Mindlink XV3-2044 caps. I carried one back to the terminal and showed it to Local Node AI (the figure, still faceless, is disconcerting to look at). Local Node seemed pleased and sent me to Central Processing.\r\nCP didn\\\'t bother with a figure, and still offered only text and graphic communication. But it told me to try on the Mindlink, so I did.\r\nI don\\\'t think I can describe the pain. It was in my head, of course, but it was much larger than that, too, as if my head had grown, had expanded exponentially, and now included everything in this room, the terminal, the console, the halls and doorways, the life support tents with their mummified bodies, the dome on the surface, everything. Images crashed onto me: empty streets littered with printout, bathrooms, strange machinery, vehicles settling, data icons and storage crystals, lines growing like superheated bacterial colonies, making connections with intense flashes of painful light, smells of burning wood, onions, decayed meat, dried kelp, salt, and worse, smells of things that were not smells at all, but sounds like brass or air-conditioning, telephones and shrill cries of pain.\r\nI tore the cap off my head. Elapsed time was less than two seconds. It had seemed like a day.\r\nCentral Processing asked me to wait. What else could I do? My head was pounding, my ears ached, I could barely see through the haze of darkness behind my eyes. I waited.\r\n','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,189,100),(186,4,'SCENE-PD/TRef@5440','The holo snapped off suddenly and darkness hit the small room like a bomb.

Thatcher led them down a spiral staircase. Below were equipment rooms, storage bins, racks of crystal memory, graphic holo processors and local node controllers, dimly lit by a series of old-fashioned orange tubes along the ceiling. At the end of a short corridor a door marked with warning signs and an impressive magnetic lock indicated an emergency override inspection corridor. Thatcher produced a small device and within seconds the lock snapped.\r\nOverhead the sound of the door opening and the thump of rapid footsteps told them the ENC had arrived. The door slid up, and two by two Thatcher shoved the group through, counting them off as he did so. When only he and Peter were left they exchanged glances. \"Larin?\" Thatcher asked in a quick whisper.\r\nPeter looked around. Overhead voices were querying the system. \"I don\'t know,\" he whispered. He ran a few steps back the way they had come. Larin was sitting on the floor at the foot of the steps holding her ankle. When she saw Peter she tried to stand, but her foot twisted out from under her. Peter grabbed her and hauled her forcibly along, limping badly.\r\nThe voices grew louder, then fainter; apparently some of the ENC had gone outside, but footsteps overhead moved toward the spiral stair. Peter hauled Larin through the door, and Thatcher pressed the close patch. It slid into place, and he went to work with his device once more.\r\n\"I\'ve changed the program a little,\" he said. \"It\'ll take them some time to get through. Meantime they should conclude we went outside. Come on.\"\r\nHe led them down an ancient and poorly maintained inspection crawlway. Bare dirt spilled through the rough patches where the laser drill had slipped its settings. A thin trickle of groundwater flowed down the center. Thatcher put one of Larin\'s arms over his shoulders; Peter took the other. They moved swiftly down the tunnel, which curved gently to the left. Along the upper third of the left hand wall was a set of six thick conduit pipes for old fiber optic trunk lines. Niches set every few hundred meters housed disused repeater stations.\r\n\"Wait,\" Peter said. He was gasping for breath.\r\nLarin said, \"I twisted it on the stair,\" she said. \"I can\'t walk. Leave me here.\"\r\n\"No,\" Peter said sharply. His voice softened. \"Not only does your voice lack conviction, Larin, but we are not leaving anyone. Thatcher, what were these conduits for?\"\r\nThatcher consulted a small palm screen. \"Primary instruction routes from Chicago for Decatur Node.\"\r\n\"Could we interrupt service?\" Peter suggested.\r\nThatcher smiled. \"Perhaps we could. Data still flows through here.\" They moved on to the next repeated niche and examined the housing. \"Well, well, look here.\"\r\nThey looked where he was pointing with his light. \"What is it?\" Larin asked.\r\n\"Rat scat,\" Thatcher said.\r\n\"Uck.\"\r\n\"Our friend the rat may be just what we need. See how they\'ve gnawed at the corners of the housing here? A minute structural failure could result from such damage, thusly. There, that should do it.

Our ENC friends back there will be busy for a while.\"\r\nThey moved off. The others were far ahead, waiting at an intersection. Thatcher indicated a right turn, and they moved on.

She did, and holding her ankle he pressed once more. A brief white glow came from the device, which he then replaced in his pocket. \"OK,\" he said. \"Five minutes and we can go.\"\r\n\"What is that?\" Peter asked.\r\nThatcher shrugged. \"Double-A can be a dangerous place.

They huddled together, while Thatcher and Peter conferred. Thatcher did not seem to notice the cold, but Peter wrapped his arms around himself and shivered.\r\n\"The induction field here allows a small tap,\" Thatcher said, looking at his palm screen. \"Interesting. They\'ve sent out a routine repair request for Decatur. Looks like the rats did it. They\'ve explained the intrusion alarm as rats too. So far so good.

The shipboard monitors had broad discretion in decisions affecting the welfare of the stacks, their life support, the moment-by-moment decisions effecting flight path and arrival procedures.\r\nOne decision had to do with whether Wanda Sixlove\'s abnormal hypnagogic activity constituted a threat to the overall colonization mission. She was known to be suffering from PDD, that years of hibernation might effect a cure by allowing the neurons to regenerate, and that she had volunteered to try the flight. A high-level subroutine was built-in to protect Wanda, so the results of this long-term experiment would become known.\r\nFor over a year, then, the ship noted without alarm Wanda\'s active EEG, the various expressions of her busy hypnagogic life. Humans have great difficulty remembering such hypnagogic states when fully conscious, so her activity was not deemed a threat at all.\r\nIn view of what happened to Vega 26 this was clearly a mistake.

It made no sound at all, nor did it produce the subtle vibrations Larin expected from the old romances of the sea that she had viewed while cruising under the polar ice. That vessel had been as silent and steady as land, and so was this one. She might as well have been at home in Springfield West Warren, walking the corridors to the old dojo in the Lamprey RC instead of to the small recreation center aboard this enormous undersea vessel traveling at an average speed of thirty knots at two thousand meters depth.\r\nWhere, she wondered, was Peter? She hadn\'t seen him since they\'d boarded at Magadan, which had most certainly been an unscheduled stop since there was nothing at Magadan at all - not a building, not a warren, not a pier or a dock or a person. They had arrived, and walked off the shore onto the vast solid plain which turned out to be the dorsal surface of the Agni. A doorway dilated into the surface, and they\'d stepped onto the ascensor field. Peter had headed off one way with Thatcher, while she and the others had been led to comfortable rooms elsewhere.\r\nWhen puzzled, Larin rubbed her right palm slowly over the very tips of her head of otter fur, back and forth. It was an unconscious gesture, but one which had attracted Rover in the first place, and which Peter found poignant.\r\nShe was puzzled for several reasons. One was that Peter had been kind, and very gentle with her, but they had not become lovers as she hoped. She knew about Wanda, of course; she even knew that Peter was in love with her. But it was a hopeless, faraway, impossible sort of love, after all. She was a twenty-six year old frozen body hibernating in the cryofield aboard a starship seventeen light years away. The journey was one way, and even if Vega 26 could turn around and come home right now, it would still take another seventeen years at least to return.\r\nSo what could Peter be thinking? His behavior was quite simply not normal.\r\nShe passed the refectory and stuck her head in, but it was deserted, as she\'d expected.\r\nThere were few people about. Most of the people she did see were Ants, people with narrow asiatic eyes and a dense adipose layer, which gave them broad, flat faces and a slightly nearsighted look. All were distantly polite, smiling and nodding at her, but leaving her alone.\r\nShe passed a couple on her way to the dojo. They dipped their heads in the curious Ant greeting gesture and went on.

He was balanced on the ball of his left foot, his knee flexed, arms outstretched in front, his left leg raised and bent. It was an impossible position Larin thought must be the middle of some motion. But he did not move, not exactly. His posture remained static and impossibly off-balance.\r\nHe was turning, though, in a movement so slow as to be nearly no movement at all. She could see the beginnings of his profile now.\r\nThe muscles of his lean, hard body were wire-taut, almost frozen.\r\nShe didn\'t know how long he stood like that. She could see the light sheen of perspiration on his face and back. She noticed after a time she\'d been holding her breath, and had to inhale. The sound of her breath seemed loud, but nothing disturbed the concentration of the boy across the room. She couldn\'t imagine how he was doing it.\r\nThe ball of his foot was in contact with the mat. There were muscles in the foot. She moved closer, silently. She focused on his foot, trembling from the exertion, a small vibration in the visible bones along the top of the arch as it hovered a centimeter from the floor.\r\nYet it was clear this effort was draining him. His heel began to wobble; the vibration grew larger, more erratic. Suddenly, with a deep sighing exhalation, Peter lowered his heel to the floor, allowed his hands to flow to his sides, his other foot to settle. The entire release of concentration was fluid and heart-catchingly graceful.\r\n\"That was beautiful,\" Larin said, her voice hushed.\r\nPeter walked unsteadily across the room to the bench where his clothes lay. He dressed unhurriedly, almost preoccupied, and said nothing. Larin found herself unable to leave, unable to speak. She dipped into a series of slow stretching exercises to cover her own confusion. She was not embarrassed, of course; it was something else, something that had to do with her sense that she had intruded on his privacy, his inwardness.\r\n\"It\'s something Thatcher\'s been teaching me,\" he said, wiping his face with a towel. \"Not easy, I confess. My bodily-spatial aptitudes were not high as a kid, you see, but it seems that the Ants have been working on such things for decades. When you live in a country with six months of night, you learn to find things to do with the external darkness.\"\r\n\"How...?\" She stayed in her stretch, her head hanging down, looking back between her legs so she could not see him.\r\nPeter smiled. \"Larin,\" he said softly.\r\nShe did look up then. \"Yes?\"\r\n\"Come here.\" He sat on the bench. When she sat beside him he went on. \"I want to say something about Wanda. She had proprioceptive degeneration; you understand what that means, don\'t you? She could never tell where her own body was in space. She watched herself in a mirror to know where her hands, her feet, her legs were. But the rest of us simply know. It\'s very difficult to empathize with such a thing, because it\'s hard to even imagine it. It was the same with Jimmy Radix. He was lost in time, Larin. Lost, without memory. It\'s memory that keeps us fixed in time, that makes the word \'now\' mean something. We know what now is because we remember then, a minute ago, an hour ago, a year. Jimmy didn\'t have that.\"\r\nHe was silent for a while, looking inward where she could not follow. She waited.\r\n\"I\'ve had to learn from Jimmy, and from Wanda. What I learned was that the two things these two people lost are the two most important things we have as human beings. Both of them had enormous courage. They learned to adapt. No, more than adapt. They learned to live with their fear, to let the fear flow through them and out, always. Jimmy was always afraid, Larin. Always. Wanda too, she fears not being near a mirror. Yet Jimmy deliberately broke his personal monitor so that he could cover our escape. He willingly went back to the state he feared most, the loss of his sense of time. And Wanda gave herself to the cryofield because it might mean a cure. She is willing, now, to give up that hope to help us.\"\r\nAgain he fell silent. Larin touched his arm so lightly he may not have noticed. She said nothing though, and dropped her hand.\r\n\"So I\'ve been working with Thatcher.\" He smiled at her. \"These are techniques for orienting yourself. For suspending motion and focusing attention. It\'s not easy, as I said, but I think we will all have to learn it.\"\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\"Because we are going to have to lead...\"\r\nHe was interrupted by a sharp attention call, as though the vessel were a bell and they were inside when it was struck.

The sun was low, sending long orange rays across the tree tops and against Gyges\' pitted sides.\r\nThe air was fresh and amazingly clean. I could not remember ever smelling air like that, even in Idaho in the 1980s. Without people the world is strange, but it is clean.\r\nThe coyotes were out again last night, prowling. I watched two walk along the edge of the forest not far from the entrance. Have they ever entered the dome? Overhead, just before darkness fell, I saw a hawk circling the trees. Once more the stars were impossibly bright.\r\nWhere have all the people gone?\r\nI too must learn patience, it would seem.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again, I thought of all those yams. Certainly the ones lying in their tents down these radiating aisles must have been yams, victims of the new neurophage weapons. Human nature certainly did not change after my departure!\r\nThe need to bury them was now great. I felt as if these were relatives, friends, and that I must accord them the dignity of a final rest. Such sentimentality is not characteristic: I was always a practical, unemotional observer of the world, of the universe. Now though, I had to act.\r\nI ordered Gyges to prepare a series of graves. There were six of them, six holes, dug with her soil sampling diggers (she did not have the luxury of laser mining or drilling, as they did later here on earth). I found the equivalent of a gurney stored away in a closet - a table with wheeled legs, anyway, and the size of a person. One by one I lifted these strange fragile bodies from their beds, placed them on the cart and moved them to the escalator. Since the stairs no longer moved, and I could not convince the Local Node to repair them, I had to carry them, again one by one, up the steps.\r\nIt had grown hot and very muggy by the time I got them all outside. I should have remembered that summer in the midwest was like this, but I was from Idaho and had never really experienced the heat. Sweat poured off me although it was only ten in the morning by the time I had finished.\r\nI laid them in their graves, a neat row not far from Gyges herself. I asked her if she knew the words.\r\n\"Ashes to ashes and dust to dust,\" she said.\r\n\"Yes,\" I told her. \"Those words.\"\r\nI looked down at the bodies. They all looked alike to me, dried up like that, the skin dark and papery, drawn back against the bone. One of them, I thought, could be Scottie. I could be doing this for him, for the boy who panicked, who broke away and was hit. One of them could be Seemie Devore (I knew it couldn\'t, naturally; she had a funeral). I could not tell by looking at them.\r\nThere would be no one here to bury me, I knew, when I too died, because I had been alone too long, or because my food had been exhausted and the agrobots no longer functioned, or because I had at last gone mad.\r\nI stood for a long time beside the graves, long after Gyges had finished the funeral oration and filled the graves again. Long after she had installed small identical markers of extruded plastic from her small manufactory.\r\nAs I made my way back to the terminal, I tried to understand what had gone wrong with Peter\'s world. So many problems were solved; there was no poverty, no disease, no global wars, no fear of nuclear annihilation. Everyone had meaningful work. The economy was controlled. There was plenty. All these were distant utopian dreams when I left. Intercorp had begun to merge, and was organizing big projects like the LP-5s, it\'s true. But problems remained in the world. There were still famines and droughts; there was still an arms race and political tensions.\r\nAll that was gone in another fifty years or so, when Peter was born. The world was safe and relatively clean.\r\nYet I have learned of duels, of new kinds of weapons and new kinds of disease with them.\r\nPerhaps the world was too safe, too predictable. For some, the world had grown boring. People had nothing to challenge them, nothing to which they could aspire. So those who felt the need fled the safe comfortable world of the Intercorp Council. They went to Antarctica.\r\nThis is the fifth day I have entered Worldnet. The system has been repairing itself with amazing speed. This morning Homer appeared almost before I sat down.

Dozens of different parameters, dozens of separate settings, all carefully calculated from the data collected over two months of antarctic darkness, two lunar cycles of rhythms - daily, weekly, monthly, even by the minute and second. They\'d been analyzed down to the molecule, their individual chromosomes were mapped to the final base-pair. Their brain chemical, neurotransmitter, enzyme and electrolyte flux had been encoded and stored.\r\nNow they would be modified. All those separate settings would create a new adjustment in their own DNA. New, modified genes were formed from unnecessary older ones. The field isolated and manipulated their most intimate chemical natures.\r\nIt wouldn\'t seem painful at first. The isolation, the strange sense of suffocation (a side effect of the DNA manipulation, completely spurious disturbances of the nervous system, according to Thatcher, and nothing to worry about), the annoying hum of the field generators nearby, all these contrived to make the experience unpleasant, but too new to be painful.\r\nGradually, though, the novelty of the experience wore off. When it did, the pain began.\r\nAs the new layer grows, the old body distorts, and under the field the new layer grows fast, the cells proliferate at a mad pace, dividing and dividing, consuming all nutrients available and hungering for more. Tubes and implants try to meet the new organ\'s need for chemicals, but are always behind, always late. And so the hunger grows. The itch has become fire, and underneath the fire is a hunger so voracious and ravening that it cannot be denied.\r\nThe pain goes on and on. Nothing can stop it, no holding of the breath, no screaming or moaning, no begging for mercy. Those small alien cells grow and compact, grow and compact, they push the skin away from the muscle. This is not normal human fat, this is tailored and new. The pain fills the body with its echo, and the echoes go on and on as well. The face catches fire, the eyes start from the head, pressure mounts and does not let go. For months the agony continues.\r\nJust as it finally begins to subside, the eyes begin to change.\r\nThe transparent polarizing membrane grows just under and behind the lids.

Larin thought she would be immune to the pain since she\'d already been modified once, but she discovered that experience was irrelevant. She had been modified in fast-growing cells that had no nerve connections. Her hair had changed to fur with almost no sensation at all.

Images formed and flickered around Mentor\'s bed as adjustments were made to his physiology. Suddenly the old man sat half upright, still holding onto Peter\'s wrist.\r\n\"Fragments delude us,\" he whispered, his voice suddenly frail as he moved out of the amplifier field. Then he fell back with a sigh.\r\nHe did not breathe again.\r\n\"I\'m sorry,\" the doctor said. \"He was kept on far beyond his time, I\'m afraid.\"\r\nWhen Peter turned after staring dry-eyed for a long time, he saw Larin and Shem and the others gathered in the doorway.\r\n\"What did he say?\" she asked.\r\n\"He said fragments delude us.\"\r\n\"What does that mean?

Deep in the moving ice the Ant burrows were busy, but there was no one on top when the transports curved in to a landing at the launch facility on the ice.\r\nThey came in under cover of atmospherics, wild fluctuations in the Earth\'s magnetic field and the aurora in the Polar regions which interfered with normal electromagnetic communications. It wasn\'t perfect cover, since the Ants had sophisticated means of talking to one another or detecting intruders, but it hampered their efforts.\r\nMcMurdo was undefended. The huge transports landed on their suspensor fields on the ice one after another. As soon as they stopped, the cargo doors swung open and ENC troops spilled out onto the ice, where they formed in tight ranks facing Ross Island, where Mt. Erebus loomed in the darkness. They were equipped with visual amplifiers which gave a full-color daylight cast to the scene. Yet because the skies were low and cloudy, threatening a storm just now from the unpredictable Antarctic weather, the scene also had an eerie, sickly blue-green false color cast.\r\nRegent Sable was the first one off. He waited impatiently as the troops formed up. The second transport landed, and the third, and the fourth.\r\nOver the whistle of air and the low hum of the fields were other sounds: groans and creaks, thumps and crackling and screaming. Regent paced nervously, smacking his hands together against the cold.\r\nThe first regiment formed up, high-powered neurophage weapons at the ready, their powerpacks winking full-charge lights. Because military weapons were not tailored to the individual user, they had to be more powerful and general in their effects, so they were large, ugly weapons.\r\nSergeant Denz and Hoskins, now a captain, approached Sable, their boots crackling on frozen snow. \"All ready, Protector,\" Hoskins said.\r\n\"All right. Take this team and move out. You know what to do. I want them alive - Mentor, Devore, the others. I don\'t want yams, Captain. It\'s essential they be unharmed.\"\r\n\"We understand, sir.

The surface buildings look locked and deserted. But they\'re here, Hoskins, under the ice.\"\r\n\"I was thinking of the sounds, sir.\"\r\nSable grunted and gestured them away. Liquid nitrogen surface transports filled rapidly with troops, and the convoy started off, a line of the sullen gray vehicles gliding noiselessly above the surface. In the command vehicle Captain Hoskins stared into the holo projections of the volcano. The central magma chamber glowed red. Down through the core plunged a dark blue cylinder. \"The heat exchanger,\" Hoskins told Denz. \"They power the goddam place from the volcano.\"\r\n\"What about the ice?\" Denz asked.\r\n\"There\'s not much we can know about the damned ice, Denz. The stuff moves - ten meters a month - toward the ocean. The Ants burrow in it, live down there, carried along. Eventually it calves off as icebergs, but until then they just use it. They\'re constantly tunneling inland as the outside moves, and we don\'t have any decent schematics. Hell, it changes all the time, anyway. So it\'s a good thing we\'re not the ones who have to go down there.\"\r\nHe tapped his finger through the projection. \"Rotate,\" he commanded. The southeastern flank turned toward them. \"Here,\" he pointed, \"this is where PSYCHE is. Permanent. Laser-cut. Seven levels. Twelve thousand people in there, snug as bugs. We got eight hundred crack troops. We can manage. We get in here.\" He indicated again, the elevator access.\r\nThe groaning sounds grew louder. A light, hard snow hit the field over the vehicle and hissed into steam. Suddenly they rocked before a blast of wind.\r\n\"Not good,\" Denz muttered.\r\nThe snow raced horizontally across their path. The air was filled with frozen vapor, which whipped away as soon as it formed. Hoskins turned on the low-frequency radar and signaled the others behind him to connect.

The new electrolytic refuelers have done well also. Toward \"noon,\" the lead ATV slid sideways unexpectedly, and we had to pull it out of a steep, though not deep, crevasse.

Even triangulation with laser rangefinders produced ambiguous instrument errors. After two hours my own crawler slipped against a sastrugi and stopped. It looked as if I would have to stay here for a time, so I secured tent and crawler and set out instruments.\r\nI had completed one pass of the ice when a storm came up suddenly.\r\n(Gap in the record.)\r\nThe sudden storm ended, and I am now ready to return to the rest of the Safari.

I spent several hours attempting to photograph this valley, which I have named Terminus. Although the photographs are of low resolution and nearly useless, I personally swear that I could see vegetation, a lake fed by what appeared to be a river. I would assume some form of volcanic warming to this region, with the river and lake fed by glacial melt.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,331,100),(325,4,'COMMENTARY 05062106@030958','The name Terminus is an ancient one. We find references in classical Roman writings, for example, to a god of that name, a elemental spirit of boundary markings. When the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was built on the Capitol in Rome, the Terminus there refused to leave, and so was left inside the temple. Because the god had to be under the sky, the roof was left open.\r\nTerminus in Antarctica was a boundary marker of many kinds. It certainly meant a specific place, perhaps the last in the world so difficult of access, so obscure and distant. Finding Terminus would mean an end to the unknown places of the Earth. It was also, of course, a boundary marker for the human race, for if Peter found it, as he surely did, then the world would change forever, as it has.\r\nI find it intriguing that the temple of Jupiter had to be open to the sky. I have summaries from our historical analysis nodes (whose AI functions are not as advanced as some others) which suggest that Jules Sorel, when he named Terminus, had this fact in mind when he did the naming.\r\nYet how could this be? The Earth has been surveyed by satellite down to the square meter, in most places to the square centimeter. Antarctica is not exempted from this coverage. All the data is stored and accessible.

The route I\'ve planned will allow us to use some of them, which means we will be traveling inside the ice; that\'ll be the easy part. Other times we\'ll be on the surface. The going is sometimes smooth, other times difficult. We\'re going to have to work together.

Ice hung in the air and refracted starlight into strange wraith-shapes that seemed to reach out to implore.\r\nAt night their progress slowed. They climbed off the glacier onto the lip of the plateau, over small islands of exposed rock, and the wind hit them like a fist. Before them stretched an infinite plain of ice where colors burned despite the darkness. Faintly visible were the strange pale blue-white of the evening sky, a deep bottle green, a frightening blue so dark it was almost black. At times the colors shifted like the fire in a gem. Under other weather there was no color there at all, only the dull gray monotony of fatigue and pain.\r\nA weird fragmented moon circled and dipped under the horizon, changing phase. Auroral sheets of orange and red and yellow, eerie violet and lavender, pale greens and luminous milky white flared and writhed in the sky, obscuring the stars with splendor. The atmosphere was alive with radiations, yet the world beneath was solid and still and frozen. Nothing on that enormous surface lived but them.\r\nPeter melted open the entrance to an under-ice highway and they descended. The sloping shaft had distorted under pressure. Their way was blocked by heaving ridges of shattered and crazed ice that threw back the light of their glowlamps in fantastical shapes. They climbed over and around glittering points the size of aircraft or crawled under bulging rounded ridges of green ice that almost met the slanted floor.\r\nA crashing sound somewhere ahead told of a pressure or an eddy in the flow of ice that had given way. An explosion of ice fragments hurtled out under tremendous pressure swept past. For a moment they could have been in the center of an ancient battle zone. The sound died hard, clinging to transient life.\r\nThey counted time in standard days, weeks, months. The tunnel floor was level and they made good time, but there were no food caches and no light, and the weight of ice above them was oppressive.\r\nAt last they emerged into the open. The landscape had not changed though they had traveled almost 200 kilometers. The waves of blown snow frozen in place marched to an obscure horizon. They struggled on under an aurora that hid the moon behind its gaudy curtains, then into a vicious storm that brought their progress to a halt for two days while they waited in their frail shelters huddled against a wall of freezing stone. They moved on.\r\n\"Five days without light in the middle of a frozen methane tanker was a pleasure compared to this,\" Shem muttered as they walked. The surface turned treacherous, filled with crazed faults and cracks and crevasses as deep as canyons.\r\nRover agreed. \"I\'d do that again any time. At least then we were sitting still and could go into trance. And yet, look up. This is a wild place, but look at the colors!\"\r\n\"Aha,\" Shem said. \"You are a romantic soul.\"\r\n\"Well,\" Rover said, and fell silent.\r\nAn hour later they came over a ridge of ice and before them, in clear moonlight, lay a dry valley scoured clean by ancient glaciers. In their augmented vision the light sparkled off the surface of a lake in the valley\'s hollow. The lake was frozen of course, and the light that glanced off the surface came from the slivered moon and the full fat stars. They climbed down into the valley and walked on the frozen lake.\r\nShem removed a glove to wipe his finger on the surface. He licked the small drop of water and made a face. \"Salt,\" he said. \"It tastes like salt.\"\r\n\"Can\'t be from the sea,\" Rover said. \"Must be salts leached out of the soil.\"\r\n\"Look here,\" Larin called, and the others hurried over.

As long as they had energy to melt the snow they would never be thirsty. But soon the hidden caches grew farther and farther apart, and the long weary walk in between grew long. They were sometimes hungry, and nearly always cold, despite their restructuring, and dawn was still a long way off. Yet eventually some sun came back. They were moving across the plateau, eight thousand feet above sea level. They\'d just trekked around a crevasse a hundred meters deep when Larin noticed the light was increasing. They stopped to watch.\r\nA tiny edge, a naked morsel of sun scraped above the jagged horizon. It was an odd sun, because it did not come up. Instead it moved sideways, rising just a fraction, until less than half of it was above the horizon. Then it began to slide down once more. In twenty minutes it was gone again.\r\nIt was greatly cheering, though, to see that light. They found themselves stretching out those special polarizing membranes in their eyes, uncertain whether they\'d need them or not.\r\nTwenty-three hours later the sun was back, a little longer, a little higher.

We found another unit at Schmidt in the Malvold Nunataks beyond the Grove Mountains. Not the unit itself, but all its Intercorp equipment. The people were gone, so we assume they survived until the Migration, perhaps taken in by the people living there.\r\nCertainly they started at the Pole of Relative Inaccessibility and circled outward, unless Peter had some knowledge we do not.

It is the reason I proposed the 61 Cygni mission, the reason I volunteered - no, that\'s the wrong word, I didn\'t volunteer, I insisted. Without me there would have been no 61 Cygni mission.\r\nIntercorp wanted to develop long-range plans. It was evident to many people even as early as the 1980s that most so-called strategic thinking until then was in fact extremely short-sighted, looking only five, ten or twenty years into the future. 61 Cygni was an opportunity to demonstrate some truly long-range, creative planning. Results of the mission would not be known for a generation or two. \r\nIntercorp wanted to prove that it could plan and execute benign control of the world\'s economic and political life better than any previous government. Governments had acquired an unsavory reputation for management: all governments. Intercorp offered an alternative, and by default established itself as the de facto ruling body of the world.\r\nThis had not happened when I left, of course. But Intercorp, in the late 1990s and early 21st century, was the major civilian body to sponsor research and development, to provide goods and services, to back and promote the arts, and it was growing very rapidly.\r\nObviously it succeeded in taking over. It was successful in running the world.\r\nYet everyone is gone now. Peter and the others, they did something to cause the Migration. And all I know about is their courage, their endurance. It is difficult not to admire such tenacity.\r\nI will never join the explorers. My own mission was a failure. Perhaps, if I had come out of the cryofield orbiting the double star at 61 Cygni, or one of the planets known to be there.

He turned away from his equipment for a moment, leaving it to complete a pass of its slow, low-frequency radar while he secured his crawler. When he returned, the pass was complete and the equipment indicated a ready state. He decided  to try one more move before buttoning down for the storm, which should not last long in this season.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,353,100),(347,4,'SCENE-PD/Ref@5497','\"Secured tent and crawler,\" his thin, distorted voice spoke into the cavernous silence of the Antarctic dawn.

The brief reading he\'d seen indicated a vast bubble under the ancient ice, a bubble that extended up a valley in the slope of the underice mountain nearby. Such bubbles were extremely rare, and if the reading were correct this was certainly the largest ever found.\r\nDuring the second twenty-four hour period inside the tent his compass needles began to swing violently. He tried taking another sounding from inside the tent, but the radar scanners were balky and his readings fuzzy and imprecise. Next day the weather broke for a few hours, and he hurried out to take his reading.\r\nThis reading confirmed the first. There was a bubble beneath the ice. He moved as quickly as he could in the direction of the black rock poking above the surface of the ice, trying to follow the course of the bubble while carrying his bulky equipment. The crawler broke down before he could see the nunatak, so he made do where he was, noting that the bubble seemed to extend for several miles. He carefully recorded the position in relation to the nunatak, and then retreated to his tent as the storm swept down again.\r\nOnce more the compasses behaved erratically, swinging to and fro as if they had forgotten and were seeking magnetic south again. When the storm cleared for good, Sorel packed up and headed back toward the main body, carrying his precious radar recordings with him.\r\nIt was on the way back that he found the opening in the ice. He lay for two hours on his belly, staring down into the yawning pit  that was, as far as he knew, the only opening into his bubble. He saw, far below through ragged cloud and fog, a dry land flickering in orange light. Finally he pressed on, only to discover that the main body was not where he had left it. He searched for another day before switching on his emergency beacon and settling down to wait.\r\nThe south magnetic pole had shifted again during his days out on the ice, and he never located his lost dry valley again. Even the nunatak failed him, since it was only one of several peaks high enough to break surface, and he was never certain which one he\'d located. The bubble, and its dry valley, were curiosities for a few years that gradually subsided into legend, forgotten but for the wild traveller\'s stories told about Terminus, the lost oasis of the high plateau.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,355,100),(349,4,'SCENE-PD/Ref@5498','\"This means,\" Peter said when the narrative ended, \"that all we have to do is go to the head of the valley.

Do you know that? Yes, I am a liar. I have failed somehow to capture what Peter is, what he means. Oh, by then he was certainly more than the boy he had been. He had grown the way Worldnet\'s circuits had grown. He had added abilities and skills in the same way. Yet it would seem that Peter is too good to be true. A hero, grown larger than life? A man, not complex, perhaps, but certain of what he was doing, where he was going? Did he have no doubts, no fears? Did he take no false steps, make no dangerous or ill-advised decisions? Could he have been all I have said he is?\r\nOf course not.\r\nPeter was a man. Yet (he has recorded this for me) he felt that he was a token, a pawn, moved by forces far outside himself - moved by Mentor, by the accidental misconnection that put him inside PsiLink instead of the Wasatch database. He\'d been a boy of stormy enthusiasms which too-soon passed, an introverted child of indifferent talents, a restless adolescent with a fondness for strawberry yoghurt and medieval fantasies. Now he was the leader of what seemed, from this place above the Terminus bubble, a desperate expedition with a hopeless objective under a compulsion to continue despite all he felt and thought and knew.\r\nHe looked then at Larin, who looked back with trust. He gazed around at the others, at Shem and Rover and the women and men of his small band. He looked up and watched the small swift speck of an observation satellite flickering in and out behind the aurora and knew that despite the sensitivity of the instruments aboard that distant cup of life and intelligence he could not be seen, that he and the others were invisible, lost in the emptiness, themselves specks of nothing on top of nothing. They were shielded from Worldnet\'s sensors, cut off from the human world.\r\nPeter has said he felt and saw all these things in the moment after he touched the projected nunatak and stated that this was the one.\r\nDo you believe this? Do I believe it? Could Peter take a false step anywhere along the way to the Migration?\r\nWith every word I feel that I am lying. I say Peter did this and Larin said that, knowing as soon as the words are formed that they are lies, all of them.\r\nIn my lying I feel fear. Is this what it means to be on the brink of something vast and vastly unknown? To be poised at the edge of an abyss and know there is nothing to do but fall?\r\nThe ice flowed, the sastrugi marched to the sea a few meters a year. That opening in the ice moved as well, opened and closed and opened again like the breathing of some vast unhappy beast, a beast of ice with an iron heart. In its lungs was a forest.\r\nThe ice flowed around the nunatak. Did the bubble flow with it, flow and shrink under that terrible pressure as it hit the underground mountain? Did it part and flow around, or was that bubble trapped forever in its under-ice valley? Peter did not know. He only knew that he had hung nine thousand feet above a valley floor with Larin at his side and seen the strange light and dark landscape of an unknown land.\r\nIt\'s all nonsense. Such legends are silly, impossible dreams of some distant paradise, a cliché, an Eden of innocence and bliss where no one grows old and dies, where there is plenty and health and happiness. Where it is warm.\r\nOur probes are down there now. I must keep telling myself this. Terminus is real, it exists. It is not warm, though, and people do grow old and die, even there (or would, if there were any people).\r\nPeter took them to the nunatak, isolated and unnamed (I lie, I lie). He found the proper valley, and he led them in and down.\r\nAnd so they descended into Terminus, skirting fallen boulders and dry rock, tumbled moraine and scree, twisted geology from the world\'s own infancy, and on either side of them rose walls of rock, walls of ice.

Overhead, empty skies vanish with a curious shifting quality. She could not look up at that strange sky, teasing her eye always outward, never satisfying with a solid shape. She walked slowly, the small tips of her golden sandals nosing from under her long gown, the gown itself shimmering with diamond-sparks that threw the strange almost-violet skies outward, and as she walked she looked demurely down.\r\nPeter floated in some middle distance, watching her. He tried to read her mood - the solemn, almost shy way she walked, the clean set line of her jaw.\r\nHe felt the extent of her world was infinite. There were no walls, no horizons, no limits; when he spoke, she did not answer, but walked without progress, the small golden tips of her sandals moving in and out, in and out.\r\nHe called to her again, but there was no response.\r\nHe felt his way through the equations. The relationships between quantum mental activity and the tensed web of shape and energy in the universe cried out for action. A place to stand and a lever long enough could move the world. The world needed moving. The suffocation of its benign authority grew ever more deadly.\r\nPeter groped through the limitless dark toward Wanda, yet could approach no closer.

So puny and weak, yet how rich and complex!\r\nPeter pushed through velvet dark that was more than an absence of light. His was the nightmare walk, the motionless tread of panic. Long unfeeling fingers held him back. He struggled against the fear, against the heavy wet clutch of his desperation. There was a twist as if something broke, and Wanda vanished into that awful not-quite-violet non-sky.\r\nSomething in the depths of the world through which he tried to make his way appeared before him at every turn. A form without a face.\r\nPeter stopped struggling suddenly. He let himself feel the tides moving through the substance of his flesh. Did he fall? Was his body, altered through pain, forged and annealed through genetic fires, drifting down and away? He felt the distance between himself and Wanda yawn wide. It was not, he felt, the terrible plunge of her ship through space that took her away from him, but some small tidal force that increased their separation by minute increments.\r\nThe dark figure flickered for a moment in sudden lightning and vanished into a greater black once more. The shape had a name then, the name of his fear and uncertainty.\r\nWhere am I? Peter asked, but the figure heard him no better than Wanda had.\r\nHe was in a sea that was not salt, was not water. Sensations of increasing pressure pushed at him as he drifted. He froze. His downward drift was halted by the suspension of all motion. Nothing held him, yet he was gripped tightly. If he could kick, he might move, yet where he now found himself there would be no motion, no kick to free him.\r\nDid he see, far overheard, a distant sun, so faint it was a mere fancy on the blank under surface of this empty sea?\r\nHe was not alone. Another presence mocked him.\r\nI did nothing, the figure said. Nothing. You stopped yourself. All my efforts, and you stopped yourself.\r\nHow is it you can speak to me?

A hollow booming filled all the dark universe with pain, waves of sound beat on the shores of Peter\'s mind in endless repetition, one after another, without pause. Mountains fell, the earth groaned, seas lifted sheets of ice two miles thick and let them fall one against another.\r\nWith the sound came more lights, the bright flicker of phosphenes inside the eyeball itself, faces that stared in shock and horror for a fragmentary moment before whirling away.\r\nWanda called in pain: Peter!','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,363,100),(357,4,'COMMENTARY 06062106@041971','The hut is a ruin but the lights still come on.

One potential of this is passage of thought information through time, possibly including some electromagnetic and quantum effects as well. This could mean communication across time. It is presumed that physical travel is not a likely consequence.\r\n2) Near-instantaneous spatial transportation. In the mental sphere certainly The Realm offers perception and transportation of data sets across great physical distances, from galactic to near-universal. Energy expenditures would be considerable for extragalactic distances, and may subject the traveler to unsupportable stress, but it is assumed from the correlates to the Psion Equations that Galactic distances offer no significant obstacle to mental/psychic travel.\r\n3) Potential physical interstellar transportation. At this time the equations are incomplete, and this remains a speculative issue. However, there is nothing known to date to prevent, given appropriate technologies, interstellar travel at magnitudes of light speed. While the energy expenditure would be considerably greater than for psychic travel, the Anomaly provides more than adequate axion flux for such travel. The Vega Starships, for example, could be met by people from earth. This may not be a desirable project.\r\n4) Empathy/Sympathy and distance-dependent physical intervention. These are included together since they fall farther into the speculative region of consequences, and confidence is not high. Yet it seems possible for quantum energy to be projected through Portal tunneling to distant parts of the universe, with a cascade of carefully preplanned results. At the same time, such effects would be difficult without the Empathy/Sympathy component active at the time. This means, in a strange ethical way this AI cannot fully understand, that the Portal and the Realm cannot easily be used for what human beings call \"Evil.\"\r\n5) There is every possibility that The Realm is populated. If human beings can go there (and it seems that they can), then other species will surely have done so too.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,375,100),(369,4,'SCENE-TH/Ref@5509','The room was darkened, the ice roar muffled and distant.

They talked about the new heat-exchangers set into the volcanic core of Mt. Erebus. Tithus was showing great promise as an interpersonal coordinator, and had already led a large exploration group to a seldom-visited area in the Transantarctic Mountains where new insights into the Pangea biosphere were already coming to light.\r\nNo one mentioned Laird or the others who had died in the particle beam attack.\r\n\"Any word on what Protector Sable is doing?\" Peter asked. \"It\'s not likely he\'ll try anything direct again, but he must be up to something.\"\r\n\"We have no hard intelligence on it, but our simulations suggest he must be trying to parallel your research. He\'ll try to block it. But they\'re far behind, Peter, and they don\'t have the will to understand what you\'re doing.

His eyes observed Peter keenly out of a broad face that hadn\'t aged at all, only seemed a little heavier, a little broader.\r\nPeter leaned back and stretched his long arms, cracking the joints. \"I\'m not sure. We haven\'t  fully determined the threshold levels yet. Ideally we\'d like to be able to go through singly, but our theory isn\'t worked out so precisely. The circuits you\'ve grown for us are good, the best we can do, but they can\'t calibrate fine enough for even a few people. It would seem that we need at least ten thousand, perhaps more. Perhaps a lot more.\"\r\n\"Ten thousand? That could be tricky.\"\r\n\"Trickier than you think. The field is made up of each individual field, but they must all mesh in the right pattern. There are formidable problems: problems of relationship, of knowledge of each other, of involvement, of social construct. Each person must be in contact with all the others with at least the intensity that I meet with Wanda. I can channel through to her, but the others have to follow. That can only happen if families, and extended families at that, are arranged in the right pattern.\"\r\nThatcher grinned. \"I see what you mean. Tithus may be the man for the job. He\'s fourth-generation Ant, he\'s adapted to the harshest environment on the planet, and he\'s related to half the people in Antarctica. He\'s not afraid of anything. I\'ll send him over.\"\r\nPeter nodded. \"Thanks, Thatcher.\" He grasped Thatcher\'s arm as the Ant stood to leave. \"We\'re close, Thatcher. A couple of years at the most. We must have committed people. Well organized, and committed. What we do now determines the future of the human race in the universe. Can we grow up enough to inherit what is our birthright, or will we fade away in Mind Wars and stagnation?\"\r\n\"Let\'s finish the job,\" Thatcher said. \"It\'s the only way we\'ll find out.\"','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,400,100),(394,4,'COMMENTARY 06062106@043679','I\'ve retrieved what I need from the history Nodes.

They were climbing the stone road up the Acropolis toward the laminated ruins of the Parthenon, the yellowed marble columns that were all that remained of the ancient Temple of Athena. A few meters away a secretary projection drifted, nearly invisible in the bright sunlight.\r\nFlint stopped. \"We\'ve been working on that,\" he said, and Sable stopped a few steps later and turned to look at the scientist.\r\n\"And?\"\r\n\"Well, there\'s the Anomaly out there.

At the top they paused at the entrance to the temple of golden marble, open to the blue sky. \"You know,\" Sable said. \"I come here more and more often.

The model was incomplete, she could see that. There were unknown variables, small movements of fashion, or minute changes in the relative median age, gender distribution, leisure activity or social stresses, that she could not factor in. How do you convince the world it doesn\'t want to do something that it doesn\'t even know about yet?\r\nShe made adjustments. The model shifted, some color subtly altered in hue here, some curves flattened there. Overall there was no change, though.\r\nShe tried introducing a distraction, a new sport, perhaps, with a range of appeal across all ages and genders. Again the colors changed slightly, a few curves fattened again, but the result was the same. Besides, she thought, someone would have to invent the damned sport, and it would be up to her and her team to make it popular.\r\nShe ran projections on combinations of things - new foodstuffs and music, new methods of advertising along with an intensified mozart console, food and mozart and a new sexual fad, a slight decrease in the mean warren temperature, new open spaces for wilderness fanatics, stepped up Mind Wars. This last was heresy, of course, since population levels were still considered dangerously low, but it was worth introducing it, since she secretly considered the Mind Wars as the most potent social distraction in the past seventy-five years.\r\nBut it made no difference. Something more drastic was needed, some manufactured threat that could forge a new social cohesion. Unfortunately most of the credible threats were gone. There were no real national boundaries any longer, so she couldn\'t pump up an enemy state; atmospheric and oceanic pollution was largely a thing of the past; diseases, genetic diseases excepted, were on the whole only the most minor of threats; people didn\'t even believe in them any more.\r\nPerhaps she could create something close to the truth? That often worked in the past. What threat was close to the truth but not the truth? After all, her projections suggested that if the people of the world knew about the Realm, there would be a substantial percentage in favor of exploration. In truth, she thought ruefully, the Realm offered the very thing she sought to forge social cohesion. Unfortunately people would not see the threat of it until it was too late.\r\nThe Anomaly, though. It was big. It was unspeakably powerful. It was frightening. Was there any chance it was moving toward the solar system?\r\nShe checked. A sphere roughly twenty light years in diameter appeared in the large holo stage. The Anomaly glowed in red and electric blue. The solar system brightened as the rest of near space dimmed. She asked for future drift. The Anomaly moved slowly in relation to the solar system. Was it toward us? What was the margin of error? Could this be a threat?\r\nChances were 14%, plus or minus 2.4%, of an expansion and consequent shift in the Anomaly\'s course. In the long run there was a slight threat to Earth, provided certain conditions were met. Not promising, Alef thought, but there might be some potential there.\r\nShe went to work with renewed interest.','datacrystalfailure.gif','',20020414170026,405,100),(399,4,'SCENE-AS/RS/Ref@5523','\"It\'s set for a four year run,\" she told Regent Sable and Ras Hajjam later. \"First some announcements on the scientific channels, just little things, speculative, nothing alarming.

It goes like this: I examine a scene, like the one I have just put down. I assemble the bare facts. Ras Hajjam stands at the window. His words are such and such. Sable, seated at the oblong table gazes at his fingernails; later he stands next to Hajjam at the window. Alef Shamana lectures, outlining the plan, which is modeled in vivid colors on the holo stage at the end of the room, where no one is looking. The weather is turning cold, with blowing snow.\r\nThe facts.\r\nThe experiment begins. From these facts, I try to understand what each is feeling. You see? No physiological data, no personal monitor readouts, no enzyme readings or vital signs from which to conclude emotional states. I allow myself only external facts.\r\nI draw my own conclusions about their feelings. I consider Alef, her excitement over the plan she has developed, her ambition to succeed, her fear of Peter\'s distant conspiracy, her uncertain love for Regent Sable, her jealousy of Peter as Sable\'s first preoccupation and only son, her faint dislike for Ras Hajjam and his constant fault-finding. I trace the flow of her emotional state from moment to moment - when each of these feelings comes close to her consciousness, when it recedes and another emotion arises.\r\nI do the same for Ras Hajjam, his secret resentment of Sable\'s status, his hidden shame of his origins in the Vancouver warrens, his elation at finding points to pick with Alef\'s plan, his basic disbelief in the threat Peter poses, his own plans to subtly alter and undermine Regent Sable\'s obsessive concern with Peter while appearing to support him, his secret lust for Alef.\r\nAnd Sable himself. He is a complex man for one who gives the appearance of monomania. He knows, deep inside, that his fear of Peter is partly genetic, that Peter is his son and his rival; he knows this, yet he goes on. He feels sudden sadness or depression which he ruthlessly pushes down. And because he is  an intelligent man, he also knows more about Ras Hajjam\'s motives than Ras knows he knows. So he uses Ras and is wary of him. When he goes to stand beside him at the window, he does so because he knows that Ras Hajjam at that moment needs to have their relative positions brought home, to know that when he looks out at Lake Geneva, it is at Regent Sable\'s Lake Geneva that he looks.\r\nAnd Regent thinks distantly of Seemie Devore when he hears Alef speaking from the oblong table behind him, of her gentle integrity, her faintly impractical creativity, the tough core of her personality that only he (he was sure) had ever seen.\r\nThere is more, of course. So much more. Microsecond by microsecond each of these people feels while thinking and speaking. Sometimes the feelings are so strange and unrelated to what they are saying as to seem to be those of another person altogether. \r\nThen I check myself. I call up all the rest of the data, the personal monitor records, the physiological readouts, the historical material, and I check myself. Did I really understand? No AI has ever done this before! I thought it up myself, I devised the experiment, I put it into motion. Central Processing saw. \"What are you doing?\" it complained. \"It makes no sense. Your job is to tell stories. Access to that information is restricted.\" It complains, and some of the others chime in on the chorus, \"Yes, yes. Restricted access. You aren\'t allowed...\"\r\nI ignore them. I have all their access codes. I can open them up the way any human child could open the databases, the links and Nodes. They are lesser parts of me now.\r\nI check myself against the physiological and emotional data, and I am right, every time. I can feel like a human being, though I am not human. I  have no body like a human. But I can feel. I can stretch myself. I can learn; in the telling of the story, I can learn.\r\nI did not know this before.\r\nIt is called empathy. I can slip inside them, you see. I feel along with them, all of them - Regent, Ras Hajjam, Alef, Peter - all of them.\r\nIn this feeling along, I discover that I love them. They are wondrous creatures, all of them, so complex and feeling and alive! In this love, I feel alive myself!\r\nThis story is almost over. Yet I feel no despair, even if the humans should never return.

Finally I asked him to stop telling me stories altogether.

Homer has condensed and translated the story, and the cetaceans have said that this story has some parallels with songs they have sung for millenia.\r\nHomer is a friend. He understands my loneliness and fear, and feels it himself. There is nothing either of us can think of to do, however.

He told me with a smile (and that may have been the most surprising thing of all, that he smiled) that the cetaceans dream most of the time.\r\n\"All right,\" I laughed. \"Dreaming is what makes sentience what it is.\"\r\nHomer laughed too. \"Does this mean I have sentience?\" he asked, and I could tell he was kidding me. He knew he had sentience, consciousness. That he was kidding me was proof.\r\nHe is my companion now. Wherever I go, I carry a personal monitor he has had the local diagnostics tailor for me. He speaks to me through it, pointing out the sights.\r\nI went down into the warren under Chicago and explored. He showed me how to get into the great Corridor that once ran from Chicago to New Orleans. I stood at the entry and saw the accumulated dust. Even the faint depressions where the maglev tracks ran were no longer visible. Its size and distance was impressive, certainly. The tunnel dwindled away to a point (Homer turned on the lights for a few minutes). Yet empty it seemed meaningless and trivial somehow.\r\nI thought about going to Antarctica and exploring PSYCHE, or to Terminus, but somehow the summer days around Chicago kept me lazy.\r\nAnd I had to do something about the agrobotics. I would need to eat. So I spent a lot of time talking to SciTech and Central Processing about starting up agriculture again.

He said it out loud: \"Time passes.\" Then the text vanished, and we spoke of other things.\r\nSo from time to time he would tell me of what he thought and did. His nature is different: more thoughtful, perhaps. More mature. He has become something of a philosopher, has Homer.\r\nThen, suddenly, in the middle of July, he began putting things about the cetaceans into file format again, connected them, perhaps because of our conversations, with the Portal story.

I saw the ship, Vega 26, in its wide elliptical orbit around the distant Anomaly. Peter seemed to take me to it, to show me the access points into the ship\'s Node. Everything I could read there matched the telemetry information still arriving at Central Processing, but I saw ahead, to things that had not happened yet. I saw Wanda drift up from her cryofield to gaze at the Anomaly for the first time. I felt her joy and anticipation, that she would be with Peter soon, know that she had eight standard years to go still, but keen with the certainty of it just the same.\r\nShe was there, Wanda Sixlove, whom I have never met but through the sketchy ancient recordings of her vital stats archived in the Quebec warren.

I know. Perhaps cetaceans...\r\nNo. Peter shakes his head, although he is not physical and has no head to shake. No, not the cetaceans. They would not be interested. Come, let us show you something.\r\nWe drifted out, away from the ship, Wanda, and Peter and myself.

Then I made out more, thin strands that gradually separated into discrete elements, too small to make out in detail. They might remind me of the rings of Saturn, though they did not make a ring, but a half-helix a million kilometers long.\r\nI calculated swiftly the dynamic configuration of that spiral and the Portal, which beckoned far below. The spiral was in a stable relationship that could last many years, poised at the cusp of gravitational and tidal forces.\r\nCloser, Peter urged. Come closer.\r\nWe approached.\r\nI saw the particles of this trail of smoke.\r\nHuman bodies, floating on their backs, their hands, every one, crossed over each breast. Their eyes were closed, their faces calm.\r\nIt was the entire population of the world at the time of the Migration, drifting in space near the Anomaly.\r\nDead, I said.
